<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>In 2000 I spent a week in the forest around Jamui in Bihar. Although badly degraded in parts and unsafe in others because of bandits, the forest and its wildlife are still relatively intact. This short sojourn offered a rare glimpse of India’s natural environment that would have been familiar to the Buddha but which has now almost completely disappeared. I saw nilghi, troops of languar, the quills of a porcupine, the glorious <em>Butea superba</em> in full bloom, a peacock and his mates and numerous other birds. At nearly every turn I was reminded of the Buddha’s descriptions of the forest and of some of the bucolic poetry in the Jātaka. It was during these few pleasant days that I conceived the idea of writing something about nature and the environment as depicted in the Pāḷi Tipiṭaka.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Prof. P. D. Premasiri, Prof. K. R. Norman and especially Anandajoti Bhikkhu, all of whom generously shared their knowledge of Pāḷi with me. I must also express my deep gratitude to Dr. S. K. Jain, former Director of the Botanical Survey of India, for his encouragement and help.</p>
<h2>Forward</h2>
<p>The first attempt to identify the plants in the Tipiṭaka was made by Robert Childers in his <em>A Dictionary of the Pali Language</em> of 1876. Childers gave about 165 plant names and provided the Linnaean nomenclature for most of these. However, more than half these names are from Pāḷi works composed in Sri Lanka and are not mentioned in the Tipiṭaka itself. Rhys Davids and Stede’s <em>Pali English Dictionary</em> published between 1921-25, includes about 420 Pāḷi plant names with the botanical names for about a third of these. Included also are about 185 animal names of which only eight include the zoological names. It is unclear what authority Rhys Davids and Stede used for the nomenclature they did give but they seem to have relied heavily on Monier-William’s <em>Sanskrit English Dictionary</em>. In her translation of the Vinaya Piṭaka published between 1938 and 1966, I. B. Horner tried to identify the various medical plants mentioned in that work and in her subsequent 1975 translation of the 
Buddhavaṃsa, she identified the various trees associated with the 28 Buddhas and other plants. In this first translation, Horner seems for the most part to have followed Rhys Davids but where not she gave her reasons for preferring a different identification. In the Buddhavaṃsa she followed George Luce who in turn must have relied on the Burmese <em>sayadaws</em> whom it would seem likely, were not familiar with plants endemic to northern India.</p>
<p>Studies in the flora and fauna in Sanskrit literature are very extensive, especially so in the case of flora because of the interest in ayuvedic medicine. As many Sanskrit names have Pāḷi equivalents such studies are relevant to the present book and I have consulted as much of this research as I have been able too. Modern Indian colloquial names for certain plants and animals likewise have proved helpful in making some identifications, although I have kept in mind Klaus Karttunen’s comment that these are “to be used with caution”.</p>
<p>A thorough compilation of material on flora, fauna and the environment from the Pāḷi Tipiṭaka is more than justified. Despite being a rich source of information on these subjects Indian scholars have largely ignored Pāḷi literature. In their contributions to the magisterial <em>History of Science, Philosophy and Culture in Indian Civilization</em> series, Rajan and Sridhar use a wide range of religious and secular literature but have only three brief references to Pāḷi canonical or post-canonical works. Ghosh and Sen’s study of botany in the post-Vedic period for <em>A Concise History of Science in India</em> utilize no Pāḷi material. Many other examples could be given.</p>
<p>In trying to identify the flora and fauna in Pāḷi literature I chose not to rely on my predecessors so as to avoid perpetuating any mistakes they might have made, and only looked at their works after having finished my own. In some cases I found that I had come to the same conclusions as them although in other cases I had not. On many occasions I was unable to identify a plant or animal but found that Rhys Davids, Horner, etc. had done so, although I could find no justification for their conclusions. It should be pointed out however, that the identity of many plants and animals mentioned in ancient Indian literature is very conjectural. As G. J. Meulenbeld has shown, there is wide disagreement amongst scholars as to which Sanskrit plant name can be identified with which plant and this comment is equally valid for Pāḷi. I have no doubt made some mistakes. My hope is that in the future someone will be able to correct these mistakes and 
also fill in the many gaps I have left.</p>

<h2>Nature and the Environment as Depicted in the Pali Tipitaka</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>There are 6400 species of fish in Jambudīpa, 4500 species of birds and 2400 species of beasts. There are 10000 species of trees, 8000 species of grass, 740 types of medicinal herbs and 43 types of aromatic plants.</p>
<p class="source">Dvādaśaviharaṇa Sūtra</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Buddha was born in and spent his whole life in what was then called the Middle Land, (<em>Majjhima Desa</em>), the broad fertile valley of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers. After his passing his teachings were committed to memory and later compiled into what is now known as the Pāḷi Tipiṭaka, the sacred scriptures of the Theravada school of Buddhism. The age of the Tipiṭaka is problematic but the core material in the Sutta Piṭaka probably dates from between the 5<sup>th</sup> and 3<sup>th</sup> centuries BCE. The exception to this is some of the books in the Khuddaka Nikāya, particularly the Jātaka. Most of the verses (<em>gāthā</em>) of the Jātaka, the only part considered canonical, are probably about the same age as the Vinaya Piṭaka (4<sup>th</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> centuries BCE). The prose stories (<em>atīta vatthu</em>) are somewhat later and the “introduction” (<em>nidānakathā</em>), the “story of the present” (<em>paccuppanna vatthu</em>) and the “connection” (<em>samodhāna</em>) are later still, 
although exactly how late is difficult to say. All these parts of the Jātaka will be used in this study. The Jātaka also reflect a knowledge of a wider geographical area than do the Sutta and Vinaya Piṭakas and include what is now lower Gharawal and Kumaon and the desert regions of Rajasthan.</p>
<p>While the bulk of the Tipiṭaka is concerned with the Buddha’s teachings, it nonetheless contains a great deal of incidental information about the social, economic, cultural and political life of the Buddha’s time. It also tells us much about the natural environment of ancient northern India and how people were influenced by and related to it. Giving a broard overview of this environment the Buddha said that“few in number are pleasant parks, forests, stretches of land and lakes, while more numerous are the steep rugged places, uncrossable rivers, dense thickets of scrub and thorns and inaccessible mountains”<span class="ref">A.i.35</span>.</p>
<p>The flora and fauna found in any area is determined to a large extent by the climate and the soil and the Tipiṭaka contains information about both. Northern India has three seasons - summer (<em>gimhāna</em>), the rainy season (<em>vassāna</em>) and winter (<em>hemanta</em>). During the summer (mid-March to mid-July), the temperatures can get as high as 43o centigrade. The trees flower and loose their leaves and hot winds blow dirt and dust into the air <span class="ref">S.v.321</span>. During the rainy season or monsoon (mid-July to mid-November) the temperature drops to about 20c and as much as 20 cm of rain can fall. Every day, usually in the afternoon, one is sure to see “a great rain cloud, thundering and pouring down refreshing rain everywhere, drenching the highlands and lowlands...” <span class="ref">It.66</span>. Rivers break their banks, insects proliferate and the landscape becomes green. During this time Buddhist monks and other ascetics would stay in one place because of the difficulty of traveling. The importance of the monsoon for 
farmers and also plant and animal life was emphasized by the Buddha when he said: “Rain sustains the life of all creatures on earth” <span class="ref">S.i.37</span>, and: “Abundant rain brings to perfection all crops for the good, the welfare and happiness of the many” <span class="ref">A.iv.244</span>. If the monsoon failed, as it sometimes did, it would spell disaster for all life. The resulting drought would cause “destitute people to wander here and there with their children in tow” and compel others to resort to banditry <span class="ref">Ja.ii.367</span> <span class="ref">Ja.vi.487</span>. Crows would abandon the cities for the forest because people no longer fed them scraps, and fish and tortoises would bury themselves in the mud of their rapidly evaporating ponds in a desperate struggle to survive <span class="ref">Ja.i.331</span> <span class="ref">Ja.ii.149</span>. The winter (mid-November to mid-January) is the most pleasant time of the year. Night temperatures can drop to as low as 5c and in the morning the grass and trees are covered with dew. The ancient Indians did not 
understand the process of evaporation and thought dew disappeared into the ground as the sun rose <span class="ref">A.iv.137</span> <span class="ref">Ja.iv.120</span>. Occasionally winter nights get cold enough for frost to form <span class="ref">M.i.79</span>.</p>
<p>Two minor seasons are occasionally mentioned as well; autumn (<em>sārada</em>), the month-long transition between the rainy season and the winter, and spring (<em>vasanta</em>), the transition between winter and summer. During the autumn “the air is clear, the sky cloudless and the sun breaking through the morning mist is hard to look at” <span class="ref">D.ii.183</span> <span class="ref">Sn.687</span>. This is also the time when the crops start to grow more robustly <span class="ref">M.i.116</span>. In the Nidānakathā, Udāyī Thera described the beauty of the countryside at the beginning of spring like this. “The winter is ended, the spring has begun, people have gathered in the harvest and are taking it along the roads. The ground is covered with fresh green grass, the forest trees are in bloom and the roads are suitable for traveling” <span class="ref">Ja.i.86</span>. A character in the Therīgātha says: “The sweet smell and the pollen of the flowers are spread in all directions by the towering trees. Indeed, early spring is a happy time”<span class="ref">Thi.371</span>.</p>
<p>The Tipiṭaka contains some observations about various meteorological phenomena related to the seasons and the weather. The Buddha identified different types of clouds which correspond in some ways to the modern cloud formation classification. The five types he mentioned are cool clouds (<em>sita</em>), warm clouds (<em>uṇha</em>), storm or thunder clouds (<em>abbha</em> or <em>thaneti</em>), wind-blown clouds (<em>vāta</em>) and rain clouds (<em>vassa</em>, <span class="ref">S.iii.254</span>). He observed that rain falls in at least two different waysÝ in large drops (<em>thulla phusitaka</em>) as 
during a monsoon downpour, and in small scattered drops (<em>ekaṃ ekaṃ</em>), as when it is drizzling <span class="ref">A.i.243</span> <span class="ref">S.i.104</span>. He also commented that the failure of the rains could be due to such things as heat, wind or the clouds being blown out over the ocean <span class="ref">A.iii.241</span>. Simple people believed that rain was caused by sky spirits called <em>vitthibhūta</em>, although gods like Sakka and Vassavalāhakadevarāja, the Rain Cloud King, could also make it rain <span class="ref">Ja.i.330</span>. It was commonly held that widespread immorality or an unjust ruler would disrupt rainfall, a belief the Buddha subscribed to. “It rains at the wrong time and fails to rain at the right time because of the bad king”<span class="ref">A.ii.74-5</span> <span class="ref">Ja.ii.124</span>. Some ascetics preyed on people’s anxieties about the rains by claiming to be able to predict good or bad rainfall <span class="ref">D.i.11</span>.</p>
<p>There is some evidence that the early Buddhists attempted to give naturalistic explanations for certain atmospheric phenomena related to seasonal changes. The <em>Milindapañha</em> asks why it is that the sun appears to shine with more glare in the winter when it is cool than in the summer when it is hot. The answer given is because in the summer the wind blows dust into the atmosphere and the resulting airborne dust particles deflect the sun’s rays <span class="ref">Mil.274</span>.</p>
<p>The soils found in the Ganges valley are mainly entisols, alfisols and ultisols with some vertisols. The <em>Vṛkṣāyurveda</em> mentions three soil types- arid, marshy and ordinary- and further sub-divides these according to color and fertility. The Tipiṭaka mentions a variety of soils- clay (<em>mattikā</em>), fine clay or kaolinite (<em>saṇhamattikā</em>), yellowish clay (<em>paṇḍumattikā</em>), sandy (<em>vālikā</em>), black alluvium (<em>kālijallikā</em>), pebbly and gravelly (<em>pāsāṇasakkharā</em>) and compact soil (<em>bhūmighana</em>). Salty soil (<em>ūsara</em>) known as <em>usar</em> in Hindi, refers to those patches of ground found in parts of Bihar which contain high concentrations of carbonate of soda, sulfate of soda, lime and magnesium <span class="ref">A.i.253</span> <span class="ref">A.iv.237</span> <span class="ref">Ja.iii.580</span> <span class="ref">M.iii.94</span>. The Tipiṭaka also comments that the soil in newly-deforested areas might be poor (<em>dubbhūmi</em>, <span class="ref">D.ii.353</span>), and that the top soil in Avanti is dark and hard (<em>kaṇhuttarā bhūmi kharā</em>, <span class="ref">Vin.i.195</span>).</p>
<p>A wide variety of habitats are mentioned in the Tipiṭaka, most of them recognizable even today. Some of these are mixed forest (<em>omissakagahana</em>), dense jungle (<em>vanasaṇḍa</em>), sal forests (<em>sālavana</em>), grassland (<em>gaccha</em>), dry thorny scrub (<em>kaṇṭakagumba</em> or <em>jaṅgala</em>), expanses of low scrub (<em>khuddakagacchavana</em>), grass jungles (<em>tiṇagahana</em> or <em>tiṇadāya</em>), bamboo jungle (<em>velagahana</em>), uninhabited virgin forest (<em>nimmanussake brahārañña</em>), waste land (<em>vivana</em>) and denuded hills (<em>muṇḍapabbataka</em>). Included also are the various wetland habitats such as river banks (<em>kūla</em> or <em>nadītīra</em>), lakes (<em>daha</em> or <em><a href="#sara">sara</a></em>), ponds and seasonal pools (<em>talāka</em>), flooded meadows (<em>kaccha</em>), swamps (<em>anūpa</em>) and marshes (<em>palipa</em> or <em>udakadaha</em>) with their reed banks (<em>naḷavana</em>), sedge plants and floating vegetation (<em>sevāla paṇaka pariyonaddā</em>). The 
Jātaka mentions semi-arid tracts (<em>kantāra</em>) and deserts (<em>marukantāra</em> or <em>nirudakakantāra</em>), which may be an early reference to Rajasthan’s Thar Desert just beyond the western edge of the Middle Land. Also mentioned are lowlands (<em>ninna</em>) which could have included floodplains. The Jātaka describes a lake around which “some high ground, in hardened mud, grew lush green grass on which fed hares, deer and other light animals”*<span class="ref">Ja.ii.26</span>. The large silt and sand islands (<em>pulina</em>) formed by the annual flooding of the major rivers and which provides a home for animals like the swamp deer, are also mentioned. One Jātaka describes a body of water near a river which would join the river during floods <span class="ref">Ja.ii.79</span>. This is a good description of what are called <em>jeels</em> or <em>chaurs</em> in Hindi, old river-beds now cut off from the present river and which form long marshes or lakes. Other habitats included man-made ones such as the muddy, stagnant village ponds (<em>jambāla</em>) and the irrigation reservoirs and tanks (<em>pokkharaṇī</em> and <em>vāpi</em>) that dotted the countryside. These filled with reeds, lotuses and other aquatic plants and became a home for crabs, mussels, fish and frogs and for the birds that fed off them. Paddy fields (<em>sālikhetta</em>) too, were an excellent habitat for various animals.</p>
<p>The most important topographical feature of the Middle Land and one that had a profound impact on the environment was its rivers. The main rivers mentioned in the Tipiṭaka are the Gaṇges, the Yamunā, the Aciravatī, the Sarabhū, and the Mahī <span class="ref">A.v.22</span>. The first two of these retain their names, the second is now called the Rapti while the identities of the last two are uncertain. Historically natural watercourses have been categorized according to their size, from large to small, as rivers, streams and brooks, although these hydrologic distinction are imprecise. Nothing like this categorization exists in the Tipiṭaka. Words such as <em><a href="#ga%E1%B9%85ga">gaṅga</a></em> and <em>nadī</em> were prefixed with <em>mahā</em> to indicate major rivers while other words like <em>āpagā</em>, <em>kunnadi</em>, <em><a href="#sara">sara</a></em> and</p>
<p>* According to ayuvedic theory the flesh of animals described as light (<em>lahu</em>) supposedly have a drying effect when eaten and produce little mucus. </p>
<p><em>savantī</em> were combined with adjectives to indicate other types of watercourses, e.g. mountain brook (<em>girinadī</em>, <span class="ref">Th.310</span>, fast-flowing creek (<em>sīghasara</em>, <span class="ref">Sn.3</span>, a shallow stream (<em>kunnadiṃ uttānatalaṃ</em>, <span class="ref">Ja.iii.221</span>) or an uncrossable rivers (<em>nadīvidugga</em>, <span class="ref">A.i.35</span>). The <em>Milindapañha</em> mentions intermittent rivers, i.e. those that dry up in the summer, saying that they cannot be rightly be called rivers for this reason <span class="ref">Mil.114</span>. An intermittent river is described as having “large undulating sandbanks along its twisting and meandering course” <span class="ref">Mil.297</span>. The Nerañjara which flows passed Bodh Gaya and several other rivers in the 
Middle Land could well fit this description.</p>
<p>The Buddha described rain storms in the mountains filling pools and lakes from where the water fed brooks and creeks <span class="ref">A.ii.140</span>. He also described a mountain river (<em>nadī pabbata</em>) as “winding this way and that, cascading, carrying everything along with it, not stopping for a minute, a second, an instant, rushing and swirling forward” <span class="ref">A.iv.137</span>. Such rivers might have grasses, reeds and trees overhanging both banks <span class="ref">S.iii.137</span>. Streams and rivers shape the landscape particularly when they are in flood. The Achivaratī (i.e. Rapti) was, and still is, notoriously prone to flash floods. When it rained in the river’s upper reaches in the Himalayan foothills, it would break its banks and sometimes wash away crops <span class="ref">Ja.iv.167</span>. Flooding rivers allow for the migration of aquatic animals, the dispersal of 
seeds, the rejuvenation of wetlands <span class="ref">Ja.ii.79-80</span> and the enrichment of the soil by depositing silt (<em>kalalagahaṇa</em>) and mud (<em>kaddama</em>) over the surrounding countryside. Mountain streams such as those in the lower Himalayas carry away sand, gravel and even rocks when in flood <span class="ref">Mil.197</span>.</p>
<p>Not actually in the Middle Land but forming its northern border are the Himalayas, sometimes called the Lord of Mountains (<em>Pabbatarāja</em>, <span class="ref">S.ii.137</span>). These mountains are only occasionally mentioned in the Tipiṭaka, as when it comments that the Buddha once stayed in a hut in a part of the Himalayas administered by Kosala <span class="ref">S.i.116</span>. This must refer to the subtropical broadleaf forests or perhaps even the higher subtropical pine forest zone of Nepal or Uttarakhand. Rugged (<em>dugga</em>) and undulating (<em>visama</em>) areas, tableland (<em>bhumibhāga</em>), inhabited and uninhabited places and areas of great natural beauty in the Himalayas are also mentioned <span class="ref">S.v.148</span>. The Jātaka says that the ascetics 
who lived in the Himalayas would leave in the rainy season when the leaves began to fall because it was difficult to dig up the bulbs and roots they lived on and to find wild fruit <span class="ref">Ja.iii.37</span>. The <em>Milindapañha</em> says that 500 rivers have their source in the Himalayas <span class="ref">Mil.114</span>. Most of the other references to these mountains are either stereotyped or idealized.</p>
<p>Pāniṇī classified all life broadly into two types - animate and inanimate. Animate creatures were divided into humans and animals, and animals were sub-divided as either domestic or wild. The Buddha also sometimes classified life forms as animate (<em>tasa</em>) and inanimate (<em>thāvara</em>, <span class="ref">Sn.146</span> <span class="ref">Sn.394</span>), and classified animate life according to either the number of their legs or their mode of birth. Thus they are either legless, two-legged, four-legged or multi-legged <span class="ref">A.v.20</span>, or alternatively, womb-born, egg-born, moisture-born or spontaneously-born, as in the case of divine beings <span class="ref">S.iii.240</span>. On one occasion only the Buddha differentiated animals according to their habitat as those living in burrows, in water, in the forest and in the air <span class="ref">A.ii.33</span>. This may be an earlier version of the habitational classifications proposed by Caraka and Suśruta.</p>
<p>*The <em>Vṛkṣāyurveda</em> says that <em>vanaspati</em> are trees that bear fruit without flowers and <em>duma</em>, probably the equivilant to <em>vṛkṣa</em> are those that have both.</p>
<p>According to the ancient Indian reckoning, all plants were of seven types - either medical herbs (<em>osadhī</em>), forest-type trees (<em>vanaspati</em>), fruit and flower-bearing trees (<em>vṛkṣa</em>),* shrubs (<em>gumba</em>), grasses (<em><a href="#ti%E1%B9%87a">tiṇa</a></em>), plants with tendrils (<em>patāna</em>) or vines (<em><a href="#valli">valli</a></em>). The Buddha classified them as either medical herbs, grasses or forest trees (<em>osadhī</em>, <em><a href="#ti%E1%B9%87a">tiṇa</a></em>, <em>vanappatayo</em>, <span class="ref">A.iv.100</span>). He considered plants to be a one-facultied life form (<em>ekindirya</em>), although he did not mention which faculty they possessed. He distinguished plants according to whether they were propagated by either roots (<em>mūla</em>), stems (<em>khandha</em>), joints (<em>phulla</em>), cuttings (<em>agga</em>) or seeds (<em><a href="#b%C4%ABja">bīja</a></em>, <span class="ref">D.i.5</span>).</p>
<p>Like any sensitive person, the Buddha was fascinated by the diversity of the natural world he saw around him. He commented: “I know of no other type of living beings as diverse as those of the animal kingdom” <span class="ref">S.iii.152</span>. This awareness of and sensitivity to animals meant that he took them into account in his Dhamma, particularly in his cosmology and his ethics. According to his understanding, the animal kingdom (<em>tiracchānayoni</em>) is one of the six realms of existence beings can be reborn into, the others being purgatory, the realm of hungry spirits, of jealous spirits, heaven and the human realm. The Buddha believed that more human beings were reborn as animals than as humans <span class="ref">A.i.36</span> and that it was a distinct disadvantage to be an animal <span class="ref">M.iii.169</span>. It would be difficult, he said, to describe the suffering animals have to endure given that their whole world is dominated by “eating each other and preying off the weak” <span class="ref">M.iii.169</span>. Likewise animals lack the ability to 
comprehend the Dhamma and have only the most rudimentary moral sense. As evidence of this he pointed out that animals will even mate with their offspring <span class="ref">A.i.51</span>. Animals” moral and cognitive inferiority to humans did not mean that the early Buddhists considered them unworthy of consideration. As far as sensivity to pain and the desire to avoid it are concerned, all beings are the same. The <em>Jātakamāla</em> says: “Because animals are dull by nature we should have sympathy for them. When it comes to being happy and avoiding suffering, all beings are the same. Therefore if you find something unpleasant you should not inflict it on others” <span class="ref">Jm.25.25-6</span>.</p>
<p>It should also be pointed out that on several occasions the Buddha acknowledged that in some ways animals can be better than humans <span class="ref">M.i.341</span>. Once he commented that an old jackal that was howling before sunrise had more gratitude than a particular monk he knew <span class="ref">S.ii.272</span>. On another occasion he rebuked some monks who were arguing and then added: “If animals can be courteous, deferential and polite towards each other, so should you be” <span class="ref">Vin.ii.162</span>. The Jātaka makes this comparison between animals and humans: “Easy to understand is the yelp of jackals and the song of birds. But to interpret what humans really mean when they speak is difficult indeed” <span class="ref">Ja.iv.218</span>. It is interesting to note that some two centuries after the Buddha, one of the points discussed during the Third Buddhist Council was whether or not animals could be reborn in heaven. Those who believed that this was possible pointed out that Erāvana, the 
mount of the god Indra, was an elephant. The Theravādins countered this by saying that if this was taken literally it would require that there also be stables, fodder, animal trainers, grooms, etc. in heaven, something that was considered to be clearly ridiculous <span class="ref">Kv.20.4</span>.</p>
<p>While marveling at the diversity of animal life, the Buddha was a careful enough observer to notice that humans are a single species, despite the widely accepted Brahminical claim that each caste represented a significantly different type. The Buddha’s response to this claim was to say that the different biological and zoological species are separated by barriers to reproduction, with hybrids usually being sterile <span class="ref">M.ii.153</span>. Different human groups, by contrast, are clearly inter-fertile and thus must be a single species. He said: “Consider the grass and the trees. Although they do not speak of it, their characteristics are due to their species and truly there are many different species. Consider grasshoppers and ants... quadrupeds great and small... snakes with their long backs and which go on their bellies... water-living fish in their watery home... and birds, those wing-goers, those sky-travelers... In these species there are many different characteristics but amongst humans the differences are few. 
Not in hair or head, ears, eyes, mouth or nose, lips or eyebrows; not in neck or shoulders, belly, back or buttocks, chest, vagina or testicles; not in hands or feet, fingers or nails, calves or thighs, color or voice is there any different characteristics due to species as in other creatures. The bodies of humans are not significantly different from each other as in animals” <span class="ref">Sn.601-10</span>. For the Buddha, if a distinction were to be made between human beings it should be based on their individual behavior or their level of comprehension, not on what caste they were born into. “Whether it be a castor oil tree, a <em><a href="#pucimanda">pucimanda</a></em> or a <em><a href="#p%C4%81libhaddaka">pālibhaddaka</a></em>, if a man looking for honey finds it there, then for him that is the best tree. Likewise, the best person is he from whom one learns the Dhamma, whether he be of the warrior, brahman or merchant caste, low caste or outcaste”<span class="ref">Ja.iv.205</span>.</p>
<p>That special regard for animals which later became such a feature of Indian civilization and which in part was due to the influence of Buddhism, was still in its infancy during the Buddha’s time. Animals were still being slaughtered at Vedic sacrifices although this was being looked upon with increasing unease. Indeed, the Buddha was one of the most vocal critics of these bloody rituals <span class="ref">A.iv.41</span> <span class="ref">A.iv.50</span>. He condemned animal sacrifices as being both cruel and wasteful. He said his monks might attend a sacrifice but only on condition that no bulls, goats, sheep, poultry or pigs were slaughtered, no trees were felled to make sacrificial posts and no grass was cut for use in the sacrificial ritual <span class="ref">D.i.141</span>. For the Buddha gentleness and kindness to all was a fundamental moral principle and also an essential step in an individual’s spiritual development. The first requirement in his code of moral discipline is to “abstain from killing, to lay aside the stick and the sword and 
to live with care, kindness and compassion for all living creatures” <span class="ref">D.i.4</span>. Anyone who wanted to be his disciple was expected “not to kill, encourage others to kill or approve of killing” <span class="ref">A.v.306</span>. For the Buddha, love and compassion were incomplete if they were not extended to all sentient beings. He said that if a monk found an animal in a trap and out of compassion set it free, he would not be guilty of theft, even if conventional opinion considered the animal to be the property of the hunter who had set the trap <span class="ref">Vin.iii.62</span>. Even the most insignificant life forms should, the Buddha said, be included in the ambit of a person’s kindly regard. One of the eight things that he allowed his monks and nuns to have as their personal property was a strainer to filter tiny creatures from water <span class="ref">Vin.ii.118</span>. Monastics were expected to check water before using it for watering plants or bathing to make sure there were 
no creatures in it <span class="ref">Vin.iv.49</span>. It was these tiny creatures that the Buddha was alluding to when he said that he had “compassion even for a drop of water” <span class="ref">M.i.78</span>. Monks and nuns were also asked to avoid unnecessarily damaging plants and their seeds <span class="ref">M.i.345</span>.</p>
<p>These and similar ideas amongst the Jains, had a profound effect on the Indian attitude to animals and later on all the peoples amongst whom Buddhism spread. In India, it became a custom during the summer to draw water from wells and put it in troughs for wild animals to drink <span class="ref">Ja.ii.70</span> and to put baskets in trees or under the eaves of houses for birds to nest in <span class="ref">Ja.i.242</span>. People would observe what were called non-killing days (<em>māghāta</em>) when no animals would be slaughtered and no meat would be available in the markets <span class="ref">Vin.i.217</span>. Such days would be announced by the beating of a drum <span class="ref">Ja.iv.115</span>. At a later period such non-killing days were given legal sanction by various Buddhist, Jain and Hindu monarchs.</p>
<p>Vegetarianism eventually became common in India although Buddhism, at least early Buddhism, did not have a direct role to play in this development. Vegetarianism was practiced by some of the unorthodox sects of the time. One of the ascetic practices the Buddha adhered to before his enlightenment was abstaining from meat and fish <span class="ref">M.i.77</span>, the Ājīvakas were vegetarian <span class="ref">M.i.238</span> as were the Jains. There were others who were not. The ascetics Kaḷāramuṭṭhaka for example, had taken a vow to consume only meat and alcohol although this did not prevent him being highly esteemed by the people of Vesāli <span class="ref">D.iii.9</span>. The Buddha did not require either his monastic or lay disciples to abstain from meat. As far as monks and nuns were concerned it was acceptable to eat meat on 
condition that they did not see, hear or suspect that the person offering the meal had killed the animal specifically for them <span class="ref">M.i.368-71</span>. There are several places in the Tipiṭaka that mention in passing the Buddha or certain monks or nuns eating meat. The Aṅguttara Nikāya comments that a man sent his servant to the market to buy meat so it could be prepared and offered to the Buddha <span class="ref">A.iv.187</span>. Another text describes how a group of people “boiled porridge and rice, made soup and minced meat”(<em>maṃsāni koṭṭenti</em>) while preparing a feast for the Buddha and his monks <span class="ref">Vin.i.239</span>. On another occasion some men slaughtered a cow, cooked it and then one of them gave “the choice cuts of the cooked meat”(<em>maṃse pakke varamaṃsāni</em>) to a nun who subsequently dressed 
it and offered it to the Buddha <span class="ref">Vin.iii.208</span>. A monk who was possessed by a malevolent spirit is said to have gone to “the place where pigs are slaughtered”and eaten raw flesh and drunk blood, apparently the accepted cure for this affliction. According to the Vinaya the Buddha permitted this rather drastic remedy <span class="ref">Vin.i.202</span>.</p>
<p>There are sufficient references in the Tipiṭaka to show that meat-eating was the norm during the Buddha’s time. Slaughterhouses are occasionly referred to <span class="ref">Ja.vi.62</span> <span class="ref">M.i.130</span> <span class="ref">Vin.i.202</span> and people are often mentioned consuming the meat of domestic and wild animals. Meat would be roasted or minced and it would be preserved by drying or salting <span class="ref">Ja.i.243</span> <span class="ref">Ja.ii.245</span>. The fact that hunters (<em>nesāda</em>) were grouped with bamboo workers, flower scavengers and carrage makers as those practicing a despised occupation <span class="ref">A.i.107</span> is not evidence that killing animals was widely disapproved of. These occupations were probably looked down upon, not because they were considered immoral or impure, but rather because the groups that did them, <em>caṇḍala</em>, <em>pukkusa</em> and <em>sudda</em>, were considered so. </p>
<p>That the early Buddhists were farmiliar with the complex food taboos of Brahmanism is evidenced by the comment in the Jātaka that “those of the warrior caste may knowingly eat the meat of the five five-clawed creatures” <span class="ref">Ja.v.489</span>. According to Brahmanical legal texts it was forbidden to eat the meat of animals that had five claws and two rows of incisor teeth. The exceptions to this rule, the so-called five five-clawed creatures (<em>pañ</em><em>ca pañ</em><em>ca nakha</em>), were the porcupine, hedgehog, hare, tortoise and monitor lizard. The Buddhists argued against or more usually simply ignored many of the superstitions of the time, including Brahmanical food taboos. Monks and nuns were not allowed to eat the flesh of certain animals, although the reasons given for such prohibitions were rational ones. Eating elephant and horse flesh for 
example, might bring unwelcome attention from kings who regarded such animals as symbols of royalty. Dogs and snakes were widely considered loathsome and eating them would result in social disapproval. Lions, hyenas and other large predators were believed to be able to smell the meat of their kind on someone who had eaten it and would attack them. The evidence given for this last reason was that some hunters had offered lion meat to a forest-living monk who ate it and was subsequently mauled by a lion. A similar thing happened to monks who ate tiger, leopard and bear flesh <span class="ref">Vin.i.219-20</span>.</p>
<p>In the Tipiṭaka it is the Jains who are depicted as the strongest advocates of vegetarianism and on this issue they were also noisy critics of the Buddha. “Many Jains went through the town, through the main roads and side streets, the alleys and the lanes, waving their arms and shouting  ‘The general Siha has this very day slaughtered a large creature to feed to the monk Gotama and he is going to eat it knowing that it was slaughtered specifically for him’”<span class="ref">A.iv.187</span>.</p>
<p>Unlike the four Nikāyas, the somewhat later Jātakas have divergent voices on the issue of vegetarianism. Adhering to the earlier position that monastics can eat meat if they have not seen, heard or suspected that an animal was killed specifically for them, the Telovāda Jātaka goes as far as to say that even eating the flesh of one’s parent would be acceptable if such conditions were met <span class="ref">Ja.ii.263</span>. This is clearly hyperbolic but it does suggest that the pro-meat side of the debate was feeling pressure from the advocates of vegaterianism. At least three Jatakas <span class="ref">Ja.75</span> <span class="ref">Ja.434</span> <span class="ref">Ja.451</span> hint at a shift towards vegaterianism.</p>
<p>Whether or not the Jātaka stories can really be attributed to the Buddha as tradition maintains, they do give a good idea of the early Buddhist attitude towards animals. The animals in these stories are often depicted in a most sympathetic manner and sometimes in contrast to the greed, thoughtlessness and cruelty of humans. Even plants were sometimes attributed with having the noblest human-like qualities. According to one Jātaka story, wayside trees, moved by compassion, lowered their branches so that hungry and weary travelers could reach their fruits <span class="ref">Ja.vi.513</span>.</p>
<p>Despite the humanizing influence of the Buddha’s teachings, cruelty to animals was common enough both during his time and later. Butchers, hunters and fishermen are occasionally mentioned and the Jātaka comments that “elephants are killed for their tusks and leopards for their skins” <span class="ref">Ja.vi.61</span>. There are also incidences in the Tipiṭaka of children tormenting animals and the Buddha admonishing them for doing so <span class="ref">Ud.11</span>. Despite claiming privileges because of their priestly role, some brahmans built huts in the forest and set traps to catch hares, cats, monitors, fish and tortoises, something the Buddhists criticized them for <span class="ref">Ja.iv.364</span>. Villagers supplemented their diets by hunting wild animals in nearby forests and gathering honey and eggs from them.</p>
<p>Later Buddhist thinkers taught that humans who tormented or killed animals, even small insects, ran the risk of being reborn in one or another of several very unpleasant purgatories. The <em>Mahāvastu</em> describes some of these infernal realms and the actions that could lead to rebirth in them. In doing so, it also gives an idea of the cruelty that was sometimes inflicted on animals. “Those who in the world cause worms to be squashed, the earth to be dug up, ... who beat creatures with clubs with the leaves still on them, or who crush nits, lice and <em>sāṇkuśas</em>, are reborn there as a maturing of their karma ... Those who in the world enslave beings who are without protection or refuge, who set houses or forests on fire, who light a fire at the openings of the dens, burrows, lairs and nests of <em>sāhikas</em>, monkeys, rats, cats, and the holes of snakes, watching their exits, who destroy bees with 
betel leaf or fire, have rebirth there as a maturing of their karma ... Those who have crushed the heads of living creatures such as snakes, centipedes and scorpions, have their heads crushed as the maturing of such karma ... Those who in the world have caused living beings to be fed to lions, tigers, panthers, bears and hyenas, are themselves devoured as the maturing of such karma ... Those who in the world scatter grain as bait for deer, buffalos, pigs and wild cocks, saying ‘We shall kill them and eat their fat flesh’ are blown on by icy wind as a maturing of such karma”<span class="ref">Mvu.i.21-5</span>.</p>
<p>In later centuries some Buddhists came to consider even unintentionally and indirectly causing animals to die to be morally wrong. The Chinese pilgrim Yijing who traveled through India during the 7<sup>th</sup>century described approvingly the inordinate lengths monks would go to in order to insure that there were no minute creatures in the water they used and to save them if there were. This concern for insects seem to have gradually soured monk’s attitude towards agriculture and must have alienated them from a good proportion of the population. The Buddha considered agriculture to be a noble (<em>ukkaṭṭatā</em>) means of livelihood because it provides people with their sustenance <span class="ref">Vin.iv.6</span>. By Yijing’s 
time farming was looked upon as reprehensible. He mentioned that some monastic communities rented out the land they owned and took a percentage of the crop, which was in accordance with the Vinaya <span class="ref">Vin.i.250</span>. Less scrupulous monks did the same but also supervised and even participated in the farming. Yijing criticized this, saying: “By ordering about the hired men who work the fields, they inevitably arouse their resentment, and by digging the soil to plant seeds as well as plowing land are libel to injure ants and other insects...” Then he added: “Nothing is more harmful to insects and more obstructive to good deeds than the cultivation of land.” No doubt Yijing was reporting the general attitude of the more strict Indian Buddhist monks of his time.</p>
<p>By the 5<sup>th</sup>century BCE large areas of forest in the Ganges valley had already been cleared to make way for agriculture. The Buddha described how a fire would “burn through the undergrowth, ignite the woods and keep burning until it came to a clearing, a cliff, rocks, water, beautiful greenery or a patch of bare ground where it would burn itself out for want of fuel” <span class="ref">A.iv.74</span>. This could well be a description of the fires that were set to push back the forests. Further evidence that the practice was common is King Asoka’s 5<sup>th</sup>Pillar Edict issued 243 BCE in which he forbad setting fire to forests. Of course, not all such fires were man-made. The Jātaka describes a forest fire (<em>davaggi</em>) being started by the friction of two tree branches rubbing together <span class="ref">Ja.i.216</span>. The Buddha also mentioned “a farmer taking a plough and seed, going to a forest 
clearing with poor soil covered with stumps and planting the seeds” <span class="ref">D.ii.353</span>. Again this suggests the opening up of forest land for cultivation. The Jātaka tells of a brahman felling trees on the bank of the Aciravatī River in order to cultivate the land <span class="ref">Ja.iv.167</span>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Tipiṭaka gives the distinct impression that there was still plenty of cover. That some forest tracts were spared human encroachment may have sometimes been due to the fauna they sheltered. The Vyaggha Jātaka tells of two tree spirits who shared their forest with a lion and a tiger. Because of the stench of carrion left by the two predators, one of the tree spirits decided to frighten his neighbors away, against the good advice of the second tree spirit. As soon as the nearby villagers noticed the absence of lion and tiger tracks “within days they cut down the forest, made fields and brought them under the plough” <span class="ref">Ja.ii.357</span>. There is evidence that that some forests were able to re-established themselves when, whether due to natural or man-made causes, human habitation went into decline. The Buddha mentions a man stumbling across the ruins of an ancient city deep in the forest <span class="ref">S.ii.105-6</span>.</p>
<p>Some stretches of forest wilderness were extensive enough that running out of supplies while traveling through them or losing one’s way in them could spell disaster. A lone traveler might be reduced to drinking water from a puddle in a cow’s footprint because nothing else was available <span class="ref">A.iii.188</span>. In extreme cases parents lost in the forest might be forced to kill and eat their child in order to survive <span class="ref">S.ii.98</span>. Villagers living near forests sometimes acted as guides for those wanting to travel through them. <span class="ref">Ja.ii.335</span>. There are records of this still being done some 500 years later. When the Chinese monk Faxian was in India in the early 5<sup>th</sup> century the road from the Middle Land to the Deccan passed through such wild and thickly forested country that travelers had to pay local rulers to provide them with guides for the journey. Such guides would accompany the traveler for a certain distance before passing them on to another guide, and so on, until they emerged from 
the wilderness.</p>
<p>The state regarded at least some forests tracts as important sources of products and revenue. The Rakkhitavanasaṇḍa, the Protected Forest Grove, near Kosambi, was probably so named because it was off limits to villagers who might otherwise harvest its resources <span class="ref">Ud.41</span>. The Buddha encountered an elephant in this forest suggesting that it was an reserve for this animal, so important in warfare. Unauthorized removal of timber from state forests could result in being flogged, imprisoned or banished, even for a monk <span class="ref">Vin.iii.43</span>. Where allowed, people gathered fruit, nuts, grasses, leaves, honey and leaf manure in nearby jungles and forest tracts. Forests provided them with the flowers they used in their religious ceremonies and with which they adorned themselves. When the Buddha was living in the forest before his enlightenment he would sometimes encounter cowherds grazing their cattle, grass-cutters, people 
gathering twigs and wood-cutters <span class="ref">M.i.79</span>. He observed that certain forests were thick with reeds and <em><a href="#sara">sara</a></em> grass <span class="ref">D.iii.75</span>, both of which were used to make various household objects such as mats, ropes and brooms.</p>
<p>People cleaned their teeth by chewing the twigs of particular trees. The Buddha spoke of the advantages of using such tooth sticks (<em>dantakaṭṭha</em>). It is good for the eyes, the breath does not have a bad smell, the taste buds are cleaned, bile and phlegm do not mix with the food, and food becomes more palatable <span class="ref">A.iii.250</span>. Twigs of the betel vine are the only wood mentioned as being used for this purpose <span class="ref">Ja.i.232</span>, but neem (<em>Azadirachta indica</em>) and babul (<em>Aracia Arabica</em>) twigs may have been used too, as they are by village folk in Bihar even today.</p>
<p>Uses were even found for India’s numerous thorny trees and bushes, otherwise considered a curse. They would be planted to make formidable hedges and their branches were cut and made into kraals where cattle were penned at night to protect them from predators <span class="ref">Vin.ii.154</span>. The more extreme ascetics sometimes lay on beds of thorns as a form of self-mortification <span class="ref">D.i.167</span> <span class="ref">Ja.iii.235</span>. Of the numerous medical herbs mentioned in the Vinaya many grew wild. On the negative side, forests sheltered animals that could raid crops and carnivores or bandits who could prey on lone travelers. Indeed, bandits were well-known to strike from and then disappear back into “impenetrable grass or trees, a thicket or a great forest” <span class="ref">A.i.153-4</span> <span class="ref">M.iii.158</span>.</p>
<p>But of course the most important resource derived from the forests was timber. Buildings, agricultural implements, boats, household articles, musical instruments, carts and wagons all required wood <span class="ref">Vin.ii.143</span> as did cooking fires. The Alīnacitta Jātaka suggests that even forests remote from human habitation were being exploited for timber on a large scale and in a systematic manner. According to this story, all the carpenters from a particular carpenter’s village wouldembark on regular trips up a river to where it ran through a thick forest. They would chop down suitablylargetrees, shape beams and planks for house building, and put together the framework of one-story and two-story houses, numbering all the pieces from the central post 
outwards. When they had enough they loaded all the timber onto boats and rowed downstream to their village. There they would build houses to order as and when they were required <span class="ref">Ja.ii.18</span>.</p>
<p>The fortifications of some cities and towns were wooden. There is mention of a royal lumber yard in Rājagaha which provided wood for repairs in the city, probably including the city’s walls <span class="ref">Vin.iii.42</span>. Kusinārā, where the Buddha passed away, was described as <em>kuḍḍa...ujjaṅgala...sākha</em> <em>nagaraka</em> <span class="ref">D.ii.146</span> which probably means that its fortifications consisted of a long mound of rammed earth or mud with a palisade running along its top, or perhaps with sharpened stakes projecting from it. Potash, probably derived from burned wood, and ash itself were used as cleaning agents <span class="ref">A.i.209</span> <span class="ref">S.ii.131</span>. Wood must have been used to bake bricks, although interestingly, there is only one reference to baked bricks or brick structures in the Sutta Piṭaka, the Brick Hall at Nādikā <span class="ref">D.ii.200</span>. The Buddha described a potter’s kiln belching smoke on first being ignited, indicating that wood rather than charcoal was used in the pottery industry <span class="ref">A.iv.101</span>. However, large amounts of charcoal must have been 
required for the newly emerging iron industry. A choice estate granted to a Brahman by a king was described as having “abundant grass, wood, water and grain” <span class="ref">D.i.87</span>.</p>
<p>Others who depended on the forest only more so were the tribal people, sometimes called <em>aṭavī</em> or <em>milakkha</em>. The Jātakas mention these people hunting birds and worshiping water <span class="ref">Ja.iv.291</span> <span class="ref">Ja.vi.207</span>. The Buddha considered it a distinct disadvantage to be reborn in the border areas (<em>paccantimesu janapadesu</em>) where the unintelligible tribal people (<em>aviññātāresu milakkhesu</em>) lived <span class="ref">A.iv.226</span> <span class="ref">S.v.466</span>, probably a reference to the those places where farm land met forest and where settled Aryans came into contact with hunter-gatherers. He also mentioned that one of the fears a mother could have for her son was that she might not be able to reach him during a raid by forest dwellers (<em>aṭavi saṅkopa</em>, <span class="ref">A.i.178</span>). In his 13<sup>th</sup> Major 
Rock Edict King Asoka pleaded with the tribal people to stop causing trouble and warned them that he had the power to chastise them if they did not. Reading between the lines we can assume that troublesome tribals were doing no more than resisting encroachment of their forest homes by farmers, foresters and hunters.</p>
<p>Scholars have pointed out that the ancient Indians saw the forest as the setting for either the hunt, the hermitage or exile. Only the second of these has any significance in early Pāḷi literature. Hunting is occasionally mentioned, usually in a condemnatory manner, and there is only one mention in the four Nikāyas of people being exiled to the forest. According to the Buddha, his clan, the Sākyans, traced their origins back to the four sons of King Okkāka who had been exiled to “the slopes of the Himalayas beside a lotus pond in a great grove of sal trees” <span class="ref">D.i.92</span>. Being somewhat later than the Nikāyas and dealing with a broader range of subjects, the Jātakas include several stories in which forest exile features. In some stories, royal personages flee to the forest to escape political intrigue <span class="ref">Ja.461</span> <span class="ref">Ja.478</span> and in one a courtier goes to live in the forest so as not to be a party to a murder (No 530). The kings in two stories are banished to the forest 
because their behavior is deemed unacceptable <span class="ref">Ja.337</span> <span class="ref">Ja.347</span> and in another story a king renounces his throne and retires to the forest because he is afflicted with an incurable disease <span class="ref">Ja.519</span>.</p>
<p>Domestic plants and their by-products were equally important in the lives of the people. The mention of a royal safflower nursery (<em>kusumbhavatthu</em>) suggests that royal courts may have maintained gardens to provide them with vegetables and various plant products <span class="ref">Ja.i.499-500</span>. Farmers cultivated numerous types of grains in their fields, vegetables in their gardens and fruit trees in their orchards. These crops could be damaged by “afflictions” such as strong winds, mice, insects, parrots and stork borers <span class="ref">Ja.v.401</span>. They could also be damages by hail (<em>karakavassa</em>, <span class="ref">Ja.iv.167</span> <span class="ref">Mil.308</span>). If the damage was extensive enough people would die of starvation and whole villages and towns would be depopulated <span class="ref">A.i.160</span>. Fields bordering forested areas might also be raided by deer <span class="ref">Ja.i.152</span> and to prevent this farmers would “dig pits with sharpened stakes and set snares, 
gins and traps” <span class="ref">J.i.143</span>.</p>
<p>The Tipiṭaka also mentions animals and plants or their by-products that were not available in northern India but were nevertheless known, either through hearsay or because they were imported from elsewhere. Sindh horses, sandalwood, marine turtles, yak tails, coral, pearls and whales are all examples of this. The Himalayas were already known to be a source of potent medicinal herbs and some of these were imported into northern India also.</p>
<p>Plants and animals had an important part to play in the cultural life of the Buddha’s India. Some were admired enough for children to be named after them. Thus the Tipiṭaka mentions names like Lion (Sīha), Banyan (Nigrodha) Lizard (Godha), Jackal (Sigāla) and Blue Water Lily Hue (Uppalavaṇṇa). On the other hand, being called a camel, a ram, an ox or an ass was considered an insult <span class="ref">Vin.iii.12</span>. Feminine beauty was likened to objects from nature. A young woman could be as slender as a <em><a href="#k%C4%81l%C4%81">kālā</a></em> bush <span class="ref">Ja.vi.269</span>, have hands as soft as cotton <span class="ref">Ja.v.204</span>, be doe-eyed <span class="ref">Ja.v.215</span>, have teeth like pearls <span class="ref">Ja.v.203</span>, lips like a <em><a href="#bimba">bimba</a></em> fruit <span class="ref">Ja.v.452</span> or nipples swollen and firm like ripe dates <span class="ref">Ja.v.302</span>. Less flatteringly, she could also have a mind like a monkey <span class="ref">Ja.v.445</span>. A maiden could be as fair as “a <em><a href="#kanik%C4%81ra">kanikāra</a></em> tree blossoming in a sheltered glade” <span class="ref">Ja.vi.269</span> while a comely youth could be “young, handsome and tender as a bean sprout” <span class="ref">Ja.iii.394</span>.</p>
<p>The Buddha and his enlightened or more advanced disciples were often compared to or equated with various animals, the most frequent being the bull elephant (<em><a href="#n%C4%81ga">nāga</a></em>), the lion (<em><a href="#s%C4%ABha">sīha</a></em>), the bovine bull (<em>āsabha)</em> and the thoroughbred horse (<em>ājāñiya</em>, <span class="ref">Dhp.193</span>; 322; <span class="ref">S.i.28</span>-9; <span class="ref">Sn.684</span>. These very animals are depicted on the abacus of the capital of the pillar King Asoka erected at Isipatana where the Buddha delivered his first sermon. The first three are also the crowning animals of all surviving Asokan capitals while the last is mentioned in one literary source as crowning the pillar in Lumbini. Different opinions have been given as to why Asoka chooses to feature these four animals on his pillars. It has been suggested that they represented the four directions, that they were symbols of royalty, of fertility, or because of their supposed cosmological or astrological significance. It is much more likely that Asoka’s choice was simply a continuation of what the earliest texts had 
done; identifying the Buddha with animals that were revered for their perceived stateliness, nobility and admirable habits. The Buddha and the bull elephant both favored living in the forest away from others <span class="ref">A.ii.116-7</span> <span class="ref">A.iv.435-7</span> <span class="ref">Ud.41-2</span>. His bold and confident claim to be enlightened was reminiscent of the lion’s fearless roar <span class="ref">A.ii.33</span> <span class="ref">A.v.33</span> <span class="ref">S.v.227</span>. Like sincere monks well-bred horses respond quiclky to training and move with deliberation and mindfulness <span class="ref">A.i.244-6</span> <span class="ref">A.ii.114</span> <span class="ref">A.iii.248</span> <span class="ref">M.i.446</span>. And just as the bull is recognized as the natural and rightful leader of the cows and calves, the Buddha’s spiritual attainments makes him preeminent amongst humankind <span class="ref">M.i.226</span>. Even in later texts such as the <em>Mahāvastu</em> the Buddha was still being called a bull elephant man, a lion man, etc <span class="ref">Mv.i.229</span> <span class="ref">Mv.ii.133</span>.</p>
<p>The ancient Indians were sophisticated connoisseur of aromatics and odorants. As part of their efforts to explain and understand and the world they analyzed the senses, their objects and sense experience, including olfactory experience. The Buddha listed pleasant odors as coming from either roots, heartwoods or flowers <span class="ref">S.iii.157</span>. Later he expanded this list to include odors from softwoods, shoots and resins or saps <span class="ref">S.iii.250</span>. Later still the <em>Dhammasangaṅi</em> expands these lists further to cover odors in general and their aesthetic properties. “Odors which are derived from the four great elements, are invisible and have an effect are root odors, heartwood odors, bark odors leaf odors, flower odors, fruit odors, raw flesh odors, putrid odors, pleasant odors and unpleasant odors” <span class="ref">Dhs.141</span>. It will be noticed that all the odors in the first two lists are derived from plants as are the majority in the <em>Dhammasangaṅi</em> list. When the Buddha’s contemporaries thought of perfumes and scents they 
thought of plant substances. </p>
<p>People washed themselves with fragrant abrasives (<em>nahāiniya cuṇṇaini</em>), applied perfumes and unguents (<em>gandhālepa</em>) after their baths and sprinkled perfumed water of the floors of their homes as a sort of ancient air-freshener <span class="ref">Ja.i.399</span>. Valuable brocades would be stored in scented chests <span class="ref">A.i.248</span> and when clothes were returned from the laundry they might be put in a scented chest to remove the smell of the cleaning agents <span class="ref">S.iii.131</span>. However, because perfumes and scents were associated with luxury and sensual indulgence the Buddha asked his lay disciples to forgo their use, at least during <em>uposatha</em>, the monthly full moon days <span class="ref">A.i.212</span>. Perfume, probably in the form of incense powder or sticks, was as an essential part of a funeral as were sweet-smelling garlands <span class="ref">D.ii.159</span> <span class="ref">Ja.iii.163</span> and the rich might have sandalwood burned in their funeral pyres <span class="ref">Ja.v.136</span>. Perfume played a part in religious 
practices. Incense was offered during pujas, scented oil was burned in lamps <span class="ref">Ja.ii.104</span> and perfumed water was sprinkled around sacred trees <span class="ref">Ja.ii.106</span> <span class="ref">Ja.iii.189</span>. The Buddha approved of offering garlands, perfume and colored paste (<em>vaṇṇaka</em>) at the shrines of enlightened saints <span class="ref">D.i.142</span>.</p>
<p>Then as now the perfume <em>par excellence</em> was sandalwood. This wood was used as a powder (<em>cuṇṇa</em>) or an unguent and fragrant oil was extracted from it also <span class="ref">D.ii.137</span> <span class="ref">Ja.v.302</span>. That Vārānasi was already a centre for perfume manufacturing and trade is implied by the Buddha’s comment that when he was a layman he used no sandalwood unless it came from that city <span class="ref">A.i.145</span>, also <span class="ref">Ja.v.302</span>. Perfumes were probably also included in the various cosmetics and salves people used, the “eye ointments, garlands, scents, face powders and face creams” (<em>anjanaṃ mālā vilepanaṃ</em> <em>mukkhacuṇṇakaṃ</em> <em>mukkhālepanaṃ</em>, <span class="ref">D.i.7</span>). Although several flowers used in perfumery are mentioned in the text the only perfume actually named other than sandalwood is sabbasaṃhāraka. As its name suggests this must have been made from a mixture of the most expensive and fragrant aroma compounds. A character in the Jātaka says she could never afford sabbasaṃhārakaand that she perfumed things with piyangu flowers <span class="ref">Ja.vi.336</span>. The Tipiṭaka makes no mention of saffron or perfumes made from animal products such as musk or ambergris.</p>
<p>Plants and animals provided the ancient Indians with opportunities for recreation and entertainment. The earliest mention of horticulture from India is to be found in the Tipiṭaka, although admittedly the evidence is scant. There are many references to parks, gardens and pleasances (<em>ārāma</em>, <em>karana</em>, <em>upavana</em> and <em>uyyana</em>). The Buddha commented that R<span class="FontFamilySylfaenSerif">ā</span>jagaha, the capital of Magadha, was adorned with numerous such places; Jīvakārāma, Lativana, Paribbājakārāma, Sītavana, Taporāma, Udumbararikārāma and Veḷuvana <span class="ref">D.ii.116</span>. Some of these places may have been small surviving patches of wild forest on the outskirts of towns and cities, others were orchards and a few were undoubtedly carefully designed and cultivated gardens. The purpose of these last places was 
to provide the enjoyment that can be derived from natural beauty; greenery, cool shade, and the color and fragrance of flowers. It is perhaps significant that the common word <em>ārāma</em> means both garden and delight.</p>
<p>Some gardens may have been part of royal palaces or the mansions of the rich and most of these seem to have been beyond city walls. Archeological investigation has shown that at least two of them, the Jetavana and the Veḷuvana, both offered to the Buddhist order by royals, were within walking distance of a major city, Sāvatthi and Rājagaha respectively. The first of these was described by the Buddha as being “not too near (the city), not too far, convenient for coming and going, quite, secluded from people, good for sitting without being disturbed and conducive to spiritual practice” <span class="ref">Vin.i.39</span>. Such attributes would have been an obvious attraction for meditating monks but they may of also have been valued by the Veluvana’s original owner, Bimbasāra the king of Magadha. Lay people too may have retreated to gardens to temporarily “get away from it all” and to reflect in the peace and quiet they offered.</p>
<p>The fact that Buddhist monks and other ascetics are often mentioned as congregating in parks and gardens and that their lay devotees would sometimes come and visit them there, indicated that some at least were open to the public. Other were reserved for their owners” use only. These private gardens might be surrounded by a wall with a gate, laid out and maintained by gardeners (<em>ārāmaropa</em>, <span class="ref">S.i.33</span>) and protected from intrusion by park wardens (<em>ārāmapāla</em>, <em>ārāmarakkhaṇaka</em>, <span class="ref">Ja.i.251</span>, <span class="ref">Vin.ii.109</span>). A royal pleasure garden might have a stone bench, a swing and inevitably a pond with lotuses and water lilies of different color. Later references to pleasure gardens in India mention other enhancements such as artificial mountains, bowers, bridges, pavilions and water machines, i.e. fountains (<em>jalayantra</em>). A king would retire to his pleasure garden to be entertained by female musicians and dancers <span class="ref">Ja.iii.40</span> and during festivals and holidays he and his court would participate in 
what were called “garden games” (<em>uyyānakīlana</em>). Unfortunately we have no information about what these games consisted of. Another activity people enjoyed in gardens was feeding animals. The Veḷuvana in Rājagaha had a place for feeling squirrels and another for feeding peafowl (e.g. <span class="ref">M.i.145</span> <span class="ref">M.ii.1</span>.</p>
<p>A few very brief references suggest that beautiful or interesting trees and shrubs would be laid out in particular patterns to enhance the attractiveness of gardens. One source mentions a line of palm trees and borders or walkways of sand <span class="ref">Ja.i.201</span>. The careful design, layout and cultivation of these gardens is further hinted at by the comment that it could take from two to four years for one with good soil (<em>sārabhūmi</em>) and proper management to be up to standard <span class="ref">Ja.ii.188</span>. So much did the ancient Indians enjoy their gardens that they assumed there must be some in heaven. The description of a celestial garden may add something to our knowledge of their earthly equivilents. Near the heavenly palace there were ponds with different colored lotuses, stocked with fish and bordered on two sides by well-trimmed fruit and flower-bearing trees <span class="ref">Vv.81.4-7</span>. The gods were believed to delight in watching the flowers as they budded, bloomed and faded, discussing each blossom’s color and shape, just as humans 
must have done <span class="ref">A.iv.117</span>.</p>
<p>A pastime less edifying than enjoying oneself in a garden was staging and watching animal fights. Large animals such as elephants, buffalos, bulls, goats and rams were set to fight each other. Cock and quail fighting were also popular. The Buddha disapproved of monks watching such fights, probably because of the cruelty involved and perhaps because gambling took place during them <span class="ref">D.i.6</span>. Another pastime involving animals was the chase. Apart from hunting as a livelihood, to supplement the diet and to provide commodities such as ivory and hides, people hunted for entertainment. Big game hunting had already reached the form it was to maintain well into the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Local villagers were recruited or compelled by kings to provide labor for such hunts. They would form a long line and beating the undergrowth and blowing horns, drive the animals before them. Eventually they would form a circle and gradually decrease its size so that the animals trapped within 
could be dispatched by the king and his guests <span class="ref">Ja.i.150</span>. Some forests were maintained specifically as hunting reserves. The Nigrodhamiga Jātaka briefly describes the setting up of one of these. Within a selected forested area fodder was sown, water was provided and a number of deer were driven in and confined there, although exactly how they were confined is not explained <span class="ref">Ja.i.150</span>. The <em>Arthaśāstra</em> described royal hunting reserves in very similar terms, adding that they were surrounded by a steep ditch so that access was only possible through a single entrance and that they were stocked with game animals and predators that had had their claws and teeth removed. When the chase was on “deer would dash around, trembling for their lives, but after one or two wounds they would faint and be slain” <span class="ref">Ja.i.150</span>. Buddhist authors pointed out that hunters did not always make a 
“clean kill”; a good number of their quarry “escaped wounded into the bushes and thickets of the forest, into clumps of grass, reeds and brambles, and died, and were devoured by ravens and vultures” <span class="ref">Mv.i.359</span>.</p>
<p>Of the austerities practiced by the various ascetic sects during the Buddha’s time some consisted, in part at least, of imitating animal behavior. The <em>Buddhacarita</em> says of some ascetics that they “eat gleanings like birds, others graze grass like deer, yet others spend their time with snakes and some stand like anthills blown by forest winds ... others plunge into the water and live with the fish, their bodies nibbled by turtles” <span class="ref">Bc.7.15-17</span>. Some ascetics walked on all fours (<em>cātukuṇḍika</em>), a practice the Buddha did for some time before his enlightenment <span class="ref">M.i.79</span>. Some went naked and acted like cow, others imitated dogs, eating only what was thrown on the ground and curling up in a canine manner to sleep <span class="ref">M.i.387</span>. The rational behind such practices is not given in the texts. The Buddha disparaged all austerities, particularly ones that involved imitating animal behavior. He said that to act like an animal would cause one to be reborn as an animal <span class="ref">M.i.387-8</span>. Some ascetics acted like 
birds by eating only seeds they picked from wild grasses or gleaned from fields after the harvest. The Buddha allowed his monks to glean (<em>uñcha</em>), not as an austerity but as a way getting sustenance when food was scarce <span class="ref">A.iii.66</span> <span class="ref">A.iii.104</span> <span class="ref">Thi.329</span>,</p>
<p>As in other religious traditions, the first Buddhists had stories about humans and animals interacting to the degree of being able to understand and respond to each others”wishes or even to talk to each other. It is not difficult to imagine how such stories could have began. Animals would soon get used to any monks or nuns who shared their forest and no longer flee from them and perhaps even become tame, especially if they were fed. An outsider visiting a hermitage and seeing normally timid animals in the vicinity might well conclude that the hermit and the animals had some sort of relationship. The Jātakas contain numerous stories in which humans interact in a variety of ways with animals.</p>
<p>A good example of such stories would be the Amba Jātaka <span class="ref">Ja.i.450</span>. Once, the Bodhisattva was born as a brahman in the North who, after he grew up, renounced the world and became leader of 500 ascetics living at the foot of the mountains. It happened that a terrible drought occurred in the Himalayan country so that all the water dried up and the animals suffered terribly. Seeing this and moved by compassion, one ascetic cut down a tree, hollowed it into a trough and filled it with any water he could find. The animals came in droves to drink and the ascetic had to spend all his time finding water and keeping the trough filled. Heedless of his own needs he toiled for the benefit of the forest creatures to the degree that he had no time to gather his own food. Seeing this the animals agreed amongst themselves provide food for the ascetic. When they came to drink they brought mangos, <em>jambus</em>, breadfruit and other fruit until it equaled 250 wagon loads, enough for all the ascetics 
with some left over.</p>
<p>The four Nikāyas and the Vinaya also included several such stories. Once Venerable Moggallāna offered to get Venerable Sāriputta the medicine he needed for a fever he was suffering from - lotus storks. He went to a great lotus lake, an elephant saw him there and asked how he could help him. Moggallāna told the elephant what he needed and the creature instructed another elephant to get it for him. This second elephant uprooted a trunk-full of lotus stalk, washed the mud off them, tied them into a bundle and then gave them to Moggallāna <span class="ref">Vin.i.214</span>. Another story of animal helping humans is told in the Udāna. The Buddha left Kosambi in disgust at the quarrelsome monks there and went to a nearby forest at Pārileyya where he spent a few days staying at the foot of a sal tree. The elephant who lived in the forest cropped the grass around the Buddha and brought him water in its trunk <span class="ref">Ud.41</span>. The ancient commentary adds that a monkey also provided him honey comb to eat <span class="ref">Dhp-a.59</span>. This 
story ends by saying that great sages like the Buddha and noble animals such as bull elephants both seek silence and solitude.</p>
<p>Once a certain monk told the Buddha that he was staying in a grove near a large area of low-lying swampy ground (<em>ninnaṃ pallalaṃ</em>) where flocks of birds foraged. In the evening the birds would roost in the monk’s grove and disturb him, probably with their noise and their droppings. The Buddha advised the monk to go to the birds three or four times a night and ask them for a feather. They would, he said, soon get sick of these continual requests and go somewhere else. The monk did this and the birds eventually went away, just as the Buddha had predicted. The Buddha used this incident to warn his monks to be circumspect about asking lay people for things. <span class="ref">Vin.iii.147</span>.</p>
<p>Stories based on the belief that animals can respond to human kindness and love are very common in the Buddhist tradition. The earliest of such stories concerns the Buddha and the domesticated but unruly and dangerous elephant Nālagiri. Once, in an attempt to kill the Buddha, his evil cousin Devadatta arranged for Nālagiri to be released onto the road the Buddha was walking down. Trumpeting and with tail erect, the elephant charged the Buddha who, on seeing the furious creature coming, suffused it with loving-kindness. The elephant was suddenly transformed from fury into docility. It approached the Buddha, took dust from his feet and sprinkled it on his own head, while the Buddha spoke to it gently and stroked it <span class="ref">Vin.ii.195</span>. In popular imagination saintly monks and nuns might even be able to influence the behavior natural prey and predators have towards each other. One Jātaka story relates how a kindly ascetic taught a snake and a mongoose to overcome their 
instinctive fear of each other <span class="ref">Ja.ii.53</span>. This story might have been the basis for a similar one the Chinese pilgrim Faxian heard when he was in Sri Lanka. A particular revered monk had developed loving-kindness to such a level that the snake and rat who shared his cave lived in complete harmony with each other.</p>
<p>The theme of animal devotion to their human owners or to those they had become fond of, and then dying of a broken heart (<em>hadayena phalitena</em>) when parted from them, occurs several times in the ancient commentaries. According to the Nidānakathā, when Prince Siddhattha renounced his princely life to become a wandering ascetic his horse Kanthaka pined away and died <span class="ref">Ja.i.65</span>. The elephant who had looked after the Buddha when he was on retreat in the Pārileyya forest was likewise said to have died when the Buddha left to return to the city <span class="ref">Dhp-a.63</span>. Another story tells of a dog who pined away when the saint it has become fond of decided to reside somewhere else <span class="ref">Dhp-a.173</span>. The various theories of kamma being discussed during the 6<sup>th</sup>/3<sup>rd</sup> centuries BCE may have been based in part on speculation on the analogy of generation in the plant world. Certainly, the concept of kamma was often explained in such terms. “Whatever type of seed is sown, that is the type of fruit one reaps. The doer of good reaps good, the doer of evil reaps evil” <span class="ref">S.i.227</span>. The Buddha called intentional good or bad deeds “seeds” (<em><a href="#b%C4%ABja">bīja</a></em>) and their kammic results “fruits” (<em>phala</em>). He spoke of his order of monks and nuns as being “an unsurpassed field” (<em>puñnña khettaṃ</em>) where seeds of merit could be sown. To make some of his ideas more understandable he sometimes equated them with various agricultural tasks. “Just as when a seed is sown in a field and grows depending on two factors, the nutrition in the soil and a good supply of water, so too, the aggregates, elements and the six bases of sense contact have come to be dependent on a cause and when the cause 
breaks up they will cease” <span class="ref">S.i.134</span>. In another discourse he compared the various steps in the spiritual life to the process of plowing. “Faith is the seed, austerity the rain, and wisdom is my yoke and plough. Modesty is the plough pole, mind the strap and mindfulness is my ploughshare and goad” <span class="ref">Sn.77</span>.</p>
<p>The forests of the Ganges and Yamuna valley were the environmental mainstay of the numerous religious sects that were proliferating during the 6<sup>th</sup> and 3<sup>th</sup> centuries BCE. The Buddha, and not only he, believed that the solitude and simple living which forest wildernesses offered, were essential for meditation. Time and again he encouraged his monks and nuns to spend as much time as they could away from human habitation and in the jungle. “Here are the roots of the trees, here are the empty places. Meditate, monks! Do not be slothful so that you reproach yourself later. This is my instructions to you” <span class="ref">A.iii.87</span>. He mentioned that some of his disciples would spend the whole year except the three months of the monsoon “at the roots of trees and in the open air” <span class="ref">M.ii.8</span>. More commonly they would “go to remote forest lodgings and having plunged into the forest only join the monastic community every half month to recite the rules” <span class="ref">M.ii.87</span>. However, Buddhist monks and nuns could never go 
too far into the wilderness. Ascetics of other sects were allowed to pluck wild fruit and dig up edible roots, while Buddhist monks were not allowed by their rule to do either. As a result, they always had to be near habitation in order to get their food.</p>
<p>But even living in the forest within walking distance of a settlement or village could be a challenge. One had to conquer the fear of predatory animals and the constant irritation of insects. The monk Ghavaratīriya counseled a heroic stoicism towards this second problem. “Annoyed by flies and mosquitoes in the forest, in the great jungle, be like an elephant in the thick of the battle and endure mindfully” <span class="ref">Th.31</span>. For some monks at least, the long periods of solitude were even more difficult to put up with. Concerning this, the Buddha commented: “Remote jungle lodgings in the forest are hard to endure. It is difficult to live in solitude, it is not easy to enjoy solitude. One might think that the forest must disturb a monk’s mind, if he has no concentration” <span class="ref">M.i.17</span>.</p>
<p>There were others who positively exalted in living in nature and away from their fellow humans. The monk Bhaddiya used to reside in the forest and every now and then let out the cry “Oh joy! Oh joy!” The other monks found his behavior rather peculiar and told the Buddha of it. The Buddha called Bhaddiya to him and asked why he was letting out this cry. Bhaddiya answered: “Formerly, when I enjoyed the happiness of royalty, guards were set inside the palace and outside in the area beyond. Yet, although I was well-guarded, I lived in fear. I was anxious, trembling and afraid. But now that I live in the forest, all alone, I am assured, confident and fearless. That is why I utter the cry Oh joy! Oh joy!” <span class="ref">Ud.19</span>.</p>
<p>Contemplating the future of the Saṅgha and suspecting that the desire for the forest life would be likely to fade, Venerable Phussa said that coming generations of monks would probably find “the jungle wilds uncomfortable and go and live in the villages” <span class="ref">Th.962</span>. During the Buddha’s last years he too predicted that the Saṅgha would probably degenerate. One sure sign of this, he thought, would be that monks would no longer live in the forest <span class="ref">A.iv.21</span>. The beginning of this trend is already present in the Vinaya. With the Buddhist Saṅgha becoming more legalistic, a precise definition of “the forest” was necessary. Technically, a monk’s abode could be designated “a jungle lodging”if it was 500 bows (dhanu) from the border of a village <span class="ref">Vin.iv.183</span>. By the time of the Visuddhimagga (5<sup>th</sup> century CE) a monk qualified to be “a forest dweller”if he lived the distance a stone thrown by man of average height standing at the precincts of a village landed <span class="ref">Vism.71-2</span>.</p>
<p>The Tipiṭaka indicates that the attraction Buddhists monks and nuns had for the natural environment sometimes went beyond the needs of their spiritual practice. Some of them were moved by the sheer beauty of the groves and hills, the flowers and the jungle pools, the rustle of the leaves and the songs of the birds. When someone told the Buddha that he found the forests frightening, he replied: “At the midday hour when the birds are quiet, I find the rustle of the great forest delightful” <span class="ref">S.i.7</span>. He specifically mentioned that he decided to settle down to do his meditation at Uruvela, in part because of the bucolic surroundings. “Then, being a seeker for the good, searching for the incomparable, matchless path of peace, while walking on tour through Magadha, I arrived at Uruvela, the army township. There I saw a beautiful stretch of ground, a lovely woodland grove, a clear flowing river with a delightful bank and a village nearby for support. And I thought ‘Indeed, this is a good place for a young man set 
on striving’.” So I sat down there, thinking ‘Indeed, this is a good place for striving’.”<span class="ref">M.i.166-7</span>.</p>
<p>The monk Bhūta claimed that the sylvan surroundings he meditated in filled him with the highest joy. “When the storm clouds rumble and pour down their torrents and the birds take to the sky, the monk who has gone to his grotto to meditate finds no greater delight than this. When happily meditating on the flowery river bank surrounded by the many and varied plants, he finds no greater delight than this. When night comes to the lonely grove with a shower of rain and the roar of the fanged beasts, the monk who has gone to his grotto to meditate finds no greater delight than this” <span class="ref">Th.522-4</span>. It was even suggested that the beauty of the landscape could be enhanced by the enlightened ascetics who chose to make it their abode. “Whether in village or forest, on hills or plain, wherever saints live, that is a delightful place”<span class="ref">Dhp.98</span>.</p>
<p>One of the most charming descriptions of the natural environment and its inhabitants in all of Indian literature is to be found in the eighth chapter of Bana’s <em>Harṣhacarita</em>. Fanciful and romanticized though it be, it invites the reader to imagine humans and animals living in complete harmony with each other through the benign influence of the Buddha’s Dhamma. Bāṇa describes a beautiful woodland scene and then the sight that unfolded before King Harṣha as he approached the hermitage of the monk Divākaramitra nestled in the Vindhyan Hills. Ascetics of different sects, usually so quarrelsome, sat on rocks, in bowers of flowering creepers, amongst the bushes and at the foot of trees, quietly discussing points of 
philosophy. “Here some monkeys who had taken the Three Refuges were gravely bowing to the shrine, there some parrots skilled in the Buddhist texts were explaining the <em>Abhidharmakośa</em>, and elsewhere a group of mynas whose practice of the Vinaya had imparted to them great composure, were giving a sermon on the Dharma. Some owls having gained wisdom by attentive study recited various Jātaka stories. Several tigers who had given up meat-eating under the calming influence of the Buddha’s teachings quietly waited in attendance. Two lion cubs sat undisturbed near Divākaramitra, forming as it were, a natural ‘lion throne’for him and emphasizing his spiritual greatness. Several deer seemed to imbibe his calmness as they licked his feet and he radiated loving-kindness while a dove sat in his left hand pecking grains of wild rice and looking like lotus buds that had dropped there from his ear. With his other 
hand Divākaramitra flicked refreshing water on a peacock, its neck like an emerald vase, and sprinkled panic seed or rice for the ants to eat, as the rays of light emanating from his body dazzled those assembled before him.” </p>
<p>The beauty of the natural world was a recurring and popular theme in the literary arts. The “Long Description of the Forest” from the Vessantara Jātaka names of about a hundred plants and nearly as many animals <span class="ref">Ja.vi.534-39</span>. When recited by a bard, this long passage must have created a vivid picture of the beauties of the forest and its inhabitants in the minds of the audience. Several other shorter eulogies to nature are found in the Jātaka and the Theragāthā (e.g. <span class="ref">Ja.vi.529</span> <span class="ref">Th.1062-70</span> <span class="ref">Th.1135-7</span>). The Buddha too would sometimes conjure up a charming if idealized vision of the natural environment.“Imagine that a man tormented and overcome with heat, wearied, craving and thirsty, were to come across a pool of clear, sweet water, a lovely resting place shaded by all kinds of trees. He would plunge into that pool, bathe and drink and coming out would sit and then recline in the shade of the trees”<span class="ref">A.iii.190</span>.</p>
<p>Poets used imagery from nature in their compositions, sometimes to the most pleasing effect. Trees were described as “swaying in the breeze like young men full of their first drink” <span class="ref">Ja.vi.534</span> or as being “studded with flowers of many hues like the night sky studded with stars” <span class="ref">Ja.vi.529</span>. In a eulogy to detachment and solitude, the Khaggavisāṇa Sutta says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Be like the lion not frightened by noise.</p>
<p>Be like the wind not caught in the web.
Be like the lotus not stained by the mud.
Be alone like the rhinoceros”horn <span class="ref">Sn.71</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pañcasikhā’s unusual but lovely poem about “the Buddha, the Dhamma, saints and love” uses imagery from nature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The elephant, oppressed by summer heat,<br>
Seeks out a lotus pool upon which float<br>
Petals and pollen of that flower,<br>
So do I plunge into your sweet breast.</p>
<p>As an elephant urged on by the goad,<br>
Ignores the sting of lance and spear,<br>
So I, unheeding, know not what I do,<br>
Intoxicated by your beauteous form.</p>
<p>By you my heart is tightly bound,<br>
My thoughts disrupted, my mind and I<br>
Can no longer find my former course:<br>
Like a fish caught on baited hook <span class="ref">D.ii.267</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plants and even more so animals were the subject of numerous superstitions and folk beliefs. Some people were believed to be able to make trees bear fruit out of season and to understand the cries of animals with the help of magic charms <span class="ref">Ja.ii.105</span> <span class="ref">Ja.iii.415</span>. It was thought to be good luck first thing in the morning to see a white bull, a mother and child, a <em><a href="#rohita">rohita</a></em> fish, a pot full to the brim or newly-made ghee, or to touch grass, fresh cow dung, a clean robe or a <em><a href="#rohita">rohita</a></em> fish <span class="ref">Ja.iv.72-3</span>. Likewise people believed that it was possible to foretell the future by examining the holes gnawed in cloth by rats or mice <span class="ref">D.i.9</span>.</p>
<p>The existence of various fantastic creatures was also taken for granted. The <em>kinnara</em> was believed to be a creature with a bird’s body and a human head, the <em>garuḷa</em> was a giant eagle-like raptor, the <em>mahoraga</em> was a serpent-like creature, the <em>dakarakkhasa</em> was an ogre that inhabited deep pools and lonely rivers, and the <em>purisa yakkhinī</em> had a woman’s body and a horse’s face. Other menacing beings that were believed to lurk in dark and lonely places were <em>yakkhas</em>, <em>rakkhasas</em>, <em>pisācas</em> and <em>supaṇṇas</em>.</p>
<p>The Buddha envisaged a time in the future when all India would be ruled by a king whose justice and wisdom would usher in an ideal society. This king would, he believed, not only act for the welfare of his human subjects but for domestic and the wild animals as well <span class="ref">A.iii.149</span> <span class="ref">D.iii.61</span>. It seems very likely that Asoka, the third emperor of the Mauryan Dynasty, saw himself as just such a “universal monarch”. Apart from his many other innovations and reforms, Asoka “made provision for two types of medical treatment; medical treatment for humans and medical treatment for animals. Wherever medical herbs suitable for humans or animals are not available I have had them imported and grown. Wherever medical roots or fruits are not available, I have had them imported and grown. Along roads I have had wells dug and trees planted for the benefit of humans and animals”. In 257 BCE. Asoka publicly announced that the royal household was going to gradually become vegetarian. “Formerly, in the kitchen ... hundreds of 
thousands of animals were killed every day to make curry. But now, with the writing of this Dhamma edict, only three creatures, two peacocks and a deer, are killed and the deer not always. And in time, not even these three creatures will be killed.” Nine years later he had published a list of animals that were to be protected from then on and designated certain days as non-killing days. “On the three Caturmasis, the three days of Tisa and during the fourteenth and fifteenth of the Uposatha, fish are protected and not to be sold. During these days animals are not to be killed in the elephant reserves or the fish reserves either. On the eighth of every fortnight, on the fourteenth and fifteenth, on Tisa, Punarvasu, the three Caturmasis and other auspicious days, bulls are not to be castrated, billy goats, rams, boars and other animals that are usually castrated are not to be. On Tisa, Punarasu, Caturmasis and the fortnight of Caturmasis, horses and bullocks are not to be branded.”</p>
<p>Much has changed in northern India since the time of the Buddha. Except for the northern fringes of the Ganges and Yamuna valley the great stretches of forest have gone forever and with them numerous species of plants and animals. Many others are critically endangered and the pressure on them increases year by year. Whatever happens in the future, the Pāḷi Tipiṭaka will remain an important record of India’s natural heritage and a valuable resource for environmental historians and others interested in India’s past.</p>
<h2>Flora and Fauna in the Pali Tipitaka</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no living being or thing that is not called by a name. The trees of the forest and the mountains are the business of the country folk. For they, on being asked “What tree is this”? say the name they know, such as <em>khidira</em> or <em><a href="#pal%C4%81sa">palāsa</a></em>. Even when they do not know the name of a tree they will say “That is a no-name tree.” And further, that will be accepted as the name for that tree. And it is the same for fish and tortoises in the ocean, and so no.</p>

Of all Indian snakes this is the one most commonly found in human habitation, whether in rural areas or crowded cities. It hides during the day and comes out at night to hunt geckos, skinks, mice, cockroaches and birds nesting in roofs. Although non-venomous, the wolf snake closely resembles the very dangerous krait and is often mistaken for it. Its its discovery in a house usually causes consternation.

<dd><p>Eel, a scaleless, snake-like fish of the order Anguilliformes, of which there are nine species in northern India. The most common and widespread eel in northern India is the Mud Eel, <em>Monopterus amphipnous</em>. Growing up to 60 mm in length and weighing as much as 1 kg, the mud eel is greenish or chestnut brown with black spots and has an elliptical head, small fins and a flat stumpy tail. The mud eel is found in rivers, swamps and rice fields situated near rivers. The Buddha referred to teachers who equivocated when asked a question as “eel-wrigglers” <span class="ref">D.i.24</span> <span class="ref">M.i.521</span>.</p></dd></dl>
<dl><dt><dfn>Amba</dfn></dt>
<dd><p>Mango, Hindi <em>am</em>, <em>Mangifera indica</em>, a large evergreen tree of which there are about 700 varieties in India and which is cultivated mainly for its delicious fruit. The fruit can be nearly round but are more commonly elongated and turned up slightly at the end and are golden-yellow color when ripe. The fruit was eaten with relish and it was also made into a drink <span class="ref">Ja.281</span> <span class="ref">Vin.i.245</span>. Mango peel was put in curries <span class="ref">Vin.ii.109</span>. The color of monks” and nuns” robes were compared to that of the mango <span class="ref">Th.197</span>. Groves of mango trees were, and indeed still are, found outside most villages in India. People planted such groves to provide fruit and to picnic in during the spring and wandering ascetics often used to reside in them. The monk Meghiya described one such grove thus: “Truly lovely and delightful is this mango grove; a good place for one wanting to meditate”<span class="ref">Ud.34</span>. Several mango groves are mentioned in the Tipiṭaka; Pāvārika’s Mango Grove at Nālandā, Cunda’s Mango 
Grove at Pāvā, the Grove of wild mangoes at Macchikāsaṇḍa and Jīvaka’s Mango Grove which was outside the east gate of Rājagaha <span class="ref">A.v.263</span> <span class="ref">D.i.47</span> <span class="ref">S.iv.281</span>.</p>
<p>One who wants mangoes will knock them out of the tree by throwing a mango at them <span class="ref">Mil.189</span>. The famous trick where a mango seed is made to apparently sprout, grow leaves, flower and then bear fruit, all within a few minutes, was already being performed by conjurers during the Buddha’s time <span class="ref">Ja.iv.324</span>.

<dd><p>Eurasian Golden Oriole, <em>Oriolus oriolus</em>, a thrush-sized bird, golden yellow with black wings and tail and a black streak through the eye. The bird’s Pāḷi name is probably due to both its ripe-mango color and the fact that it arrives in northern India in Spring just as the mangoes ripen, although in some areas it is resident. The Eurasian golden oriole is arboreal and feeds on fruits, berries and nectar.

<dl><dt><dfn>Assa</dfn></dt>
<dd><p>Horse, also called <em>haya</em> and <em>turaga</em>, <em>Equus caballus</em>. The horse is a large herbivorous mammal adapted for running and which has been domesticated for at least 5000 years. A thoroughbred was called <em>assājāniya</em> <span class="ref">A.i.77</span> <span class="ref">M.i.124</span>, a nag <em>assakhaluṅka</em> <span class="ref">A.i.287</span>, a mare <em>vaḷavā</em> <span class="ref">M.ii.153</span> and a foal <em>assapotaka</em> <span class="ref">Ja.ii.288</span>. The finest horses were imported into northern India from Sindh <span class="ref">Dhp.322</span> and were called <em>bhojjha</em> <span class="ref">Ja.i.180</span> or <em>sindhava</em> <span class="ref">Ja.i.175</span> <span class="ref">Ja.ii.96</span> <span class="ref">Ja.iii.287</span>. The Kathiawari, India’s indigenous horse, was probably derived from the cross-breeding of Sindh and Arab horses in the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Horses were too expensive to be used for ordinary transport and were reserved mainly for royalty,for chariots and for cavalry during war. Chariots and cavalry were two of the four branches of the army. The importance of horses in ancient India is suggested by the space given to their care, maintenance and 
training in the <em>Arthaśāstra</em>.</p>
<p>A horse fit for a king was expected to have five qualities; to have a good stud line, when given food, whether green or dried, it should eat it carefully and not scatter it about, it will not lay in its own dung, it should not fight with the other horses, it should show itself as it is to its trainer, and it should pull the carriage properly <span class="ref">A.iv.188</span>. Horses were trained using gentle means, harsh means and a combination of both <span class="ref">A.ii.110</span>. This is similar of the <em>Aśvaṣāstra’s</em> advice that a combination of gentleness, rewards and punishment is the best way of training horses. Horses were trained in special grounds and were penned either in stables or in circular corrals and fed steamed rice <span class="ref">Vin.iii.5</span>. We read of the best three-year-old rice fed to a king’s Sindh horse <span class="ref">Ja.i.178</span>. A good horse would respond even to the shadow of the whip <span class="ref">A.ii.113</span> and a thoroughbred was expected to be endowed with beauty, stamina, speed <span class="ref">A.i.243</span> and be finely proportioned <span class="ref">A.i.288</span>. A highly-strung horse would not move when urged on, upset the carriage, kick up its hind legs and break the shafts, rear up in the air and pull at the bit <span class="ref">A.iv.190</span>. Ropes and cords were made out of horsehair <span class="ref">A.iv.129</span> <span class="ref">S.ii.238</span> as were sieves <span class="ref">M.i.229</span>, brushes <span class="ref">A.i.209</span> and bird snares <span class="ref">Ja.v.362</span> and couches were stuffed with it <span class="ref">Vin.ii.170</span>. Being able to judge a good horse was a respected skill and horsemanship was an art taught to princes <span class="ref">A.iii.152</span> <span class="ref">A.iii.326</span>. The Vedic horse sacrifice (<em>assamedha</em>) was still being performed by kings <span class="ref">A.ii.42</span> <span class="ref">S.i.76</span> and fights between stallions were arranged for entertainment <span class="ref">D.i.7</span>. Horses” tails were sometimes platted <span class="ref">D.i.105</span>. The Tipiṭaka mentions the castration of animals and men who preformed this job, although there is no specific mention of this being done to stallions <span class="ref">Ja.iv.364</span> <span class="ref">M.i.383</span>. The Buddha urged his disciples to be like a good horse. “Like a well-bred horse touched by the whip, be eager 
and swift” <span class="ref">Dhp.144</span>. King Asoka’s 5<sup>th</sup>Pillar Edict mentions that branding horses and cattle was banned on certain full-moon days. According to the Jātaka, the Bodhisattva was once reborn as a Sindh horse <span class="ref">Ja.i.178</span>.</p></dd></dl>

Mules were used as pack animals and to draw carts and chariots <span class="ref">S.i.211</span>. The best mules were bred in Kamboja in north-west India <span class="ref">Ja.vi.342</span>. The ancient Indians knew that mules were sterile <span class="ref">M.ii.153</span>. The Buddha once said: “Well trained mules are excellent as are thoroughbred Sindh horses and noble tusked elephants; but better still is he who has trained himself”<span class="ref">Dhp.322</span>.</p></dd></dl>
<dl><dt><dfn>Assattha</dfn></dt>
<dd><p>Bodhi Tree, Hindi <em>pipal</em>, <em>Ficus religiosa</em>. This variety of fig has large spreading boughs and leaves ending in a characteristic pointed tip. The <em>assattha</em> is semi-parasitic, sometimes growing up against other trees and stunting them <span class="ref">S.v.96</span>. It can also grow on the walls of buildings causing them great damage. The small fruit of the tree was called <em>pipphala</em> <span class="ref">Ja.vi.518</span>. Like other figs, it grows from a tiny seed into a huge tree <span class="ref">S.v.96</span>. It was said that a woman’s heart beats on seeing her son “as the tender leaves of the <em>assattha</em> tremble in the breeze” <span class="ref">Ja.v.328</span>.</p>
<p>The <em>assattha</em> was considered sacred in India centuries before the Buddha and is represented in seals from Mohenjodaro dating from before 1000 BCE. The Buddha stated that he had attained enlightenment at the foot of an <em>assattha</em> tree <span class="ref">D.ii.4</span> and the actual one he was sitting under at the time was sometimes called “The Tree of Knowledge” (<em>Jñānadruma</em>, <span class="ref">Bc.13.65</span>). This tree is referred to in the four Nikāyas as “The Tree of Awakening” (<em>Bodhirukkha</em>) although it is only mentioned twice (<span class="ref">D.ii.4</span> <span class="ref">Ud.1</span> repeated at <span class="ref">Vin.i.1</span>) in the earliest part of the Tipiṭaka.</p>
<p>Before the Buddha’s enlightenment, the area around the Bodhi Tree was covered with silvery sand without a blade of grass growing on it and all the surrounding trees and flowering shrubs were bending as if in homage towards it <span class="ref">Ja.iv.233</span>. According to the Nidānakathā, the Buddha spent his second week at Uruvelā (i.e. Bodh Gaya) gazing at the Bodhi Tree out of gratitude for the shelter it had offered him <span class="ref">Ja.i.77</span>. The same text says that as the Buddha sat meditating beneath the Bodhi Tree, <em>aṅkura</em> the colour of red coral sprinkled down on him as if they were an offering <span class="ref">Ja.i.75</span>. <em>Aṅkura</em> usually means a shoot but here it must refer to the glossy crimson sheathing stipuls that are cast off as the new leaves of Bodhi trees develop.</p>
<p>In the early centuries of Buddhism, the <em>assattha</em> tree became a symbol of the Buddha and in the sculptures of both Bharhut and Sanchi he is depicted as such. In the <em>Mahāvastu</em>, he is actually given the epitaph “Great Tree” (<em>Mahādruma</em>, <span class="ref">Mv.ii.280</span>). A branch of the Bodhi Tree was brought to Sri Lanka by the nun Saṅghamittā, the daughter of King Asoka, in the 2<sup>nd</sup> century BCE and is believed to still grow in Anurādhapura. A distant ancestor of the original Bodhi Tree grows behind the Mahābodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya.</p></dd></dl>

Both these cormorants are black with a small patch of white on the throat. The main difference between them is their size, the first being about as big as a domestic duck and the second about half that size. Also, the great cormorant has a yellow beak while the little cormorant’s is black. Both birds are commonly seen singly or in small flocks on large lakes where they hunt fish by diving and chasing them underwater.

<dd><p>Cluster Fig, Hindi <em>dumbar</em>, <em>Ficus glomerata</em>, a large tree with a buttressed trunk, dark-green ovate leaves and which produces reddish mildly sweet figs that grow in clusters on short branches. A spendthrift or a wastrel was called an “<em>udumbara</em> eater”, i.e. one who shakes all the figs out of the tree and then only eats a few <span class="ref">A.iv.283</span>. There was a grove of these trees near the Bamboo Grove at Rājagaha where wandering ascetics used to stay and where the Buddha had a discussion with the ascetic Nigrodha <span class="ref">D.iii.36</span>.</p>
<p>Like several other species of Indian figs, this one was an object of curiosity to the ancient Indians because it appeared to produce fruit without first bearing flowers. The Buddha said that one cannot find an essence in existence any more than one can find a flower in a cluster fig <span class="ref">Sn.5</span> <span class="ref">Vv.50.16</span>. The <em>Mahāvastu</em> says: “It is no easier to win sight of the Buddha, great in glory, empathy, compassion and beneficence, than it is to see a flower in a cluster fig” <span class="ref">Mv.i.270</span>. In fact, the fruit of the cluster fig itself is the flower. The head of the flower turns inward to produce a vase-like fleshy casing inside which are numerous tiny flowers.

This creature has a long graceful body with short legs and a beautiful smooth, shiny, chocolate-brown coat with a lighter underside. Otters live in rivers and streams and feed on fish, crustaceans, frogs and birds. Slippers were sometimes made out of otter skin <span class="ref">Vin.i.186</span>.

<dd><p>Turtle, sometimes also <em>kuma</em> or <em><a href="#kumma">kumma</a></em>, reptiles of the order Chelonia. Turtle live in marine or freshwater habitats while tortoises, sometimes called land turtles, are terrestrial. Four species of marine turtles swim in Indian waters, the most common being the Hawksbill Turtle, Hindi <em>samudra kachakra</em>, <em>Eretmotochelys imbricata</em>. The Buddha was probably referring to this turtle in his well-known statement about the rarity of being born human and of coming into contact with the Dhamma. “Monks, suppose this great earth were covered with water and a man were to throw a yoke in it and blown by the wind it were to drift north, south, east and west. Suppose also that once every hundred years a blind turtle were to surface. What do you think? What are the chances that the blind turtle were to put its head through the yoke?” “It is very unlikely, Lord.” “Monks, it is just as unlikely that one will be reborn as a human, just as unlikely that a Tathāgata 
should appear in the world, just as unlikely that the Dhamma should be taught to the world” <span class="ref">S.v.457</span>.</p>
<p>Freshwater turtles are mentioned in the Tipiṭaka although it is not possible to identify any of the several species that inhabit the rivers and ponds of northern India. They were described as having four legs, a neck like a pole and a body round like a banyan tree <span class="ref">Ja.ii.152</span>. Some of the behavior of turtles that were observed included floating on the surface of the water but on seeing someone quickly submerging, coming out of the water to bask in the sun, digging burrows in the banks of rivers and withdrawing into their shells at the first sign of danger <span class="ref">Mil.370-2</span>. Freshwater turtles were eaten and we read of those living in lakes being speared with harpoons <span class="ref">S.ii.227</span>. They were believed to be able to tell when there was going to be a drought <span class="ref">Ja.ii.80</span> and at such times would burrow into the mud trying to keep wet <span class="ref">Ja.i.331</span>. If a turtle was on the bank of a river and a predator like a jackal aproached, it would withdraw into its shell and remain still <span class="ref">S.iv.177</span>. A thing or event that was impossible 
was referred to as “a turtle’s hair” <span class="ref">Ja.iii.477</span>. The Buddha said the meditative monk should in some ways imitate the land turtle. “Just as the turtle withdraws its limbs into its shell, a monk should withdraw his mind and thoughts” <span class="ref">S.i.7</span>.

The various words for monkey in the Tipiṭaka seem to be used loosely and interchangeably as is suggested by the mention of a large black-faced monkey, a clear reference to the Hanuman Langur, and a small red-faced monkey, a reference to the Rhesus Macaque. In both cases the word <em><a href="#makka%E1%B9%ADa">makkaṭa</a></em> is used <span class="ref">Ja.ii.445</span>. However, many of the numerous stories about monkeys in the Jātakas would seem to refer mainly to the macaque because this monkey would have been more familiar to most people and because of its more human-like appearance and often amusing antics.</p>
<p>Monkeys pull faces and threaten people <span class="ref">Ja.ii.70</span> and while moving through the forest they grab a branch and let go of it only to grab another <span class="ref">S.ii.95</span> <span class="ref">Sn.791</span>. Hunters used to go into the forests of the Himalayan foothills and set traps of sticky pitch to catch them. The more curious monkeys would touch the pitch, get stuck and while trying to free one paw would get their other paws stuck. The hunters would then kill them, put the carcass on a spit and cook them over a fire <span class="ref">S.v.146</span>. Mahākassapa said that a monk who wears rag robes and yet is conceited, is like a monkey wrapped in a lion’s skin <span class="ref">Th.1081</span>. Street entertainers had monkeys which were trained to play with snakes and to do tricks <span class="ref">Ja.iii.198</span>. In the Jātaka, monkeys are depicted as having the best and worst human traits and attitudes. According to the Jātaka, the Bodhisattva was often reborn as a monkey.

About half the size of the domestic chicken, this bird has a blotched-chestnut back, wings and tail, a lighter-colored breast and a rufus throat circumscribed by a black line. The sexes are the same except that the male has spurs on its legs. The grey francolin favors dry scrub and grassland and feeds on insects and seeds. When disturbed it flies off with a loud whirling sound. It is also a fast runner. Hunters would imitate the francolin’s call to attract them and then catch them with nets <span class="ref">Ja.i.208</span>. The <em>Gṛhya Sūtra</em> says that feeding a baby boy francolin flesh will impart to it the bird’s plump and contented-looking appearance. The Jātaka says that the reason why francolins are plump is because their minds are content and still, because they do not stray far from home and because they maintain themselves with whatever food they get <span class="ref">Ja.iii.313</span>.

A familiar bird the world over, the blue rock pigeon is slate grey with a shining metallic green and purple sheen on its breast and neck and pink legs and eyes. The English name is due to the pigeon’s habit of nesting and roosting on cliffs and in rocky places. The pigeon is as much at home in lightly-forested and open country as it is in villages and towns. The Buddha described old bones as being pigeon-colored <span class="ref">Dhp.149</span>. One of the places around Rājagaha where monks sometimes used to stay was called Pigeon’s Cave <span class="ref">Ud.39</span>. According to the 5<sup>th</sup> Pillar Edict, King Asoka forbade the killing of white pigeons and village pigeons. The <em>Arthaśāstra</em> mentions tying messages to the pigeon’s legs.

The species mentioned in the Tipiṭaka might be <em>Gossypium arboreum</em> as Brahmins make their sacred threads only from this type, suggesting its antiquity. This species of cotton is a large shrub with slender, sometimes purple branches, small, smooth leaves and large, beautiful purple flowers.

Cotton cloth was the most common fabric used in ancient India. After being harvested and separated from the seed, the fiber was spun into thread and then woven into cloth <span class="ref">D.iii.351</span>. Nakulamātā, one of the Buddha’s female disciples, was very accomplished at spinning cotton <span class="ref">A.iii.295</span> and the Brahmin 
Velāma once made a gift of 84,000 lengths of cotton cloth <span class="ref">A.iv.394</span>. Cotton was used for a variety of purposes including padding sandals <span class="ref">Vin.i.196</span>. When asked what should be done with his body after his final Nirvana, the Buddha said that it should be wrapped in new cloth, then in teased cotton wool and then in new cloth. That being done, it should be placed in an iron coffin and then cremated <span class="ref">D.ii.142-3</span>. Referring to one of his super normal powers, the Buddha once said: “Just as a wisp of fluff or cotton when blown by the wind easily rises up into the air, so too, when the Tathāgata immerses the mind into the body and the body into the mind and he abides in a blissful and buoyant perception towards the body, his body easily rises into the air” <span class="ref">S.v.284</span>.

<dd><p>Camphor, <em>Cinnamomum camphora</em>, the name of a tree and a whitish crystalline aromatic substance extracted from it and certain other trees <span class="ref">Ja.vi.537</span>. Camphor was used as a perfume <span class="ref">Ja.i.290</span> <span class="ref">Ja.ii.416</span>, a medicine, to flavor water and in religious ceremonies. Ancient texts distinguished two types of camphor; “unheated” i.e. free crystals found in the wood or on the bark, and “heated” i.e. prepared by steam distillation. Both <em>Carakasaṃhitā</em> and <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> mention the medicinal qualities of camphor and it is still used to treat diarrhea and as a cardiac stimulant. Because it burns with a strong incandescent light and leaves no ash, camphor has long been favored for lamps in religious offerings.</p>
<p>Concerning the harvesting of camphor in India, Xuanzang wrote: “The tree from which camphor scent is procured is in trunk, like the pine, but with different leaves, flowers and fruit. When the tree is first cut down and sappy it has no smell but when the wood gets dry it forms into veins and splits; then in the middle is the scent, in appearance like mica, in color like frozen snow.”Apart from the camphor tree camphor can also be extracted from <em>Blumea balsamifera</em> (Sanskrit <em>kukudru</em>, <em>kukkuradru</em> or <em>kukundara</em>), <em>B. densiflra</em>, <em>B. junghuhniana</em> and <em>Nardostachys grandiflora</em> although none of these plants except the first are mentioned in the Tipiṭaka.</p></dd></dl>

They are commonly seen in urban areas where they dart up walls and lay on tree branches warming themselves in the sun. Sandals were sometimes decorated with squirrel skin <span class="ref">Vin.i.196</span>.

Several species of crow live in northern India, the most common being the House Crow, <em>Corvus splendens</em> and the Jungle Crow, <em>Corvus macrorhynchos</em>, also called <em><a href="#vanak%C4%81ka">vanakāka</a></em> in Pāḷi <span class="ref">Ja.iii.247</span>. The first is black with a grey neck, mantle and breast while the second is a glossy black all over. Both are alert, aggressive and daring birds that do not hesitate to attack animals much larger than themselves either to rob them or to protect their young. The Buddha said that crows are truculent and pushy, greedy and gluttonous, cruel and pitiless, rough and harsh-voiced, muddle-headed and given to hoarding things <span class="ref">A.v.149</span>. They are described as making a “<em>kā kā</em>” sound <span class="ref">Ja.iv.73</span>. One monk was said to have had a voice like a 
crow <span class="ref">Vin.i.115</span>, meaning that it was harsh and unpleasant.</p>
<p>Commenting on the fact that crows are always lean, the Jātaka says: “Their hearts are always agitated and they vex the whole world, therefore crows have no fat on them” <span class="ref">Ja.i.486</span>. In one place a crow is described as turning over dry cow patties to eat the insects under them <span class="ref">Ja.i.242</span>, and in another we read of an abandoned infant surrounded by crows <span class="ref">Vin.i.268</span>. We also read of crows picking out the eyes of an impaled criminal with “their dagger-like beaks” <span class="ref">Ja.i.500</span>. As soon as a devotee leaves a shrine, crows appear and examine the offering for anything edible <span class="ref">Ja.v.107</span>. An old man is described as having feet like a crow,perhaps meaning that they were dry and scaly or that the toes were spread <span class="ref">J.vi.548</span>.</p>
<p>The crow often featured in the proverbs of the Buddha’s time. Somebody could be “as impudent as a crow” <span class="ref">Dhp.244</span>, leftover food was called “a crow’s meal” <span class="ref">Ja.ii.149</span> and a presumptuous boastful person was called a “crow hero” <span class="ref">Dhp.244</span>. A boy of seven or eight was said to be “big enough to frighten the crows” <span class="ref">Vin.i.79</span> and to have “the wisdom of a crow” meant making a decision based on greed rather than common sense <span class="ref">Ja.v.225</span>. To be helpless was to be “like a crow with its wings clipped” <span class="ref">Ja.i.304</span>. A river or pool could be “full enough for a crow to drink from” <span class="ref">D.i.244</span> and crops growing well were “high enough to hide a crow” <span class="ref">Ja.ii.174</span>. Crows often appear in the Jātakas where they are usually depicted as cunning, greedy creatures. See <strong><a href="#ba%E1%B8%B7%C4%AByakkha">Baḷīyakkha</a></strong>.</p></dd></dl>

Being very aromatic and having a sharp taste, these leaves are used to flavor food and chewed as an appetizer <span class="ref">Ja.vi.24</span>. They are also eaten during famines and by the poor. According to the Jātaka, when the Bodhisattva was an ascetic living in the forest he used to eat curry leaves after having soaked them in water without salt, buttermilk or spices in it, suggesting that that was the usual way to eat them, perhaps as a sort of salad <span class="ref">Ja.vi.21</span>.</p>
<p>What is called curry today is a combination of spices powdered and then added to food to flavor it. The Pāḷi word for a curried dish is <em>sūpa</em> and is usually used together with a varietycondiments <span class="ref">A.iii.48</span>.

The Pāḷi name means “thing-me-bob.” The <em>kiṃsuka</em> is a common, small to medium-sized tree usually with a blackish crooked trunk, broad leaves shiny on top and velvety underneath and which look greyish from a distance. A profusion of red or orange flowers appear after the leaves fall. The pods are velvety-brown, about 15 centimeters long and contain flat oval-shaped seeds. When flowering a blood-red juice issues from the trunk and branches and hardens into an astringent gum which has medicinal uses. Lac insects are often cultivated on this tree.</p>
<p>Once, a monk asked several of his fellows how insight is attained and each gave him a different answer. Confused, he went and told the Buddha what the other monks had said and the Buddha replied. “Suppose a man who had never seen a <em>kiṃsuka</em> tree went and asked another man what such a tree looked like. The other might answer ‘A <em>kiṃsuka</em> tree is blackish, like a charred stump’. So for the first man it would appear as the other man sees it. Then he might go to another man and ask him what a <em>kiṃsuka</em> tree is like and the other might reply ‘It is reddish, like a piece of meat’. So for him it would appear as the other man sees it. Then he might go to yet another man and ask him what a <em>kiṃsuka</em> tree is like and the other might say “Its bark hangs down in strips and its pods burst like a <em><a href="#sir%C4%ABsa">sirīsa</a></em> ”. So for him it would appear as the other man sees it. Finally, the man might go to one more person and put his question again and the other might reply “A <em>kiṃsuka</em> tree has 
a thick foliage and gives a close shade like a banyan tree”. So for him it would appear as the other man sees it. In the same way, those advanced men each gave you their answer according to their purified vision” <span class="ref">S.iv.193</span>.</p>
<p>We read of the branches of a <em>kiṃsuka</em> tree being weighed down with fruit <span class="ref">Ja.i.367</span>. According to the Jātaka the Bodhisattva was reborn as a spirit in a flame of the forest tree worshipped by the people of Vārānasi <span class="ref">Ja.iii.23</span>.</p></dd></dl>

<dd><p>Indian Roller, <em>Coracias benghalensis</em> <span class="ref">J.v.408</span>. About the size of a pigeon, the Indian roller has a large head, a heavy black beak and short legs. The bird is most well-known for its beautiful blue wings and harsh raucous call. It gets its English name from its spectacular courtship display which involves dramatic somersaulting, darting and nose-diving. The Pāḷi name is probably an onomatopoeia of the bird’s call. Once the Bodhisattva used the example of the contrasting screech of the beautifully colored roller to teach a beautiful but shrewish queen to speak more pleasantly <span class="ref">Ja.ii.350</span>. Popular tradition attributed the roller hen with strong maternal instincts, a belief reflected in a passage from the Jātaka. “The Teacher checks his disciples as a roller inspects her egg, a yak guards her tail, a mother her beloved child or a one-eyed man his only eye” (

<dd><p>Yeast, Hindi <em>kinva</em>, a fungi of the class Ascomycetes which is used to ferment the sugars in grains and fruits, to raise dough and to produce alcohol <span class="ref">Vin.iv.109</span>. Five main types of alcoholic beverages are mentioned in the Tipiṭaka. <em>Meraya</em> <span class="ref">M.i.238</span> was distilled alcohol made from sugar or fruit and sometimes flavored with sugar, pepper or the bark of <em>Gymnema sylvestre</em>. <em>Majja</em> and <em>surā</em> <span class="ref">Sn.398</span> <span class="ref">Vin.i.205</span> were brewed from rice or flour but later these names were used generally for any fermented beverage. <em>Āsava</em> was also a generic name <span class="ref">Ja.iv.222</span> and later five types were recognized - that made from flowers, fruit, honey, sugar or a mixture of some or all of these ingredients. The <em>Arthaṣāstra</em> gives this recipe for <em>āsava</em> - 10 <em>palas</em> of <em>kapitha</em> pulp, 500 <em>palas</em> of sugar cane juice and 1 <em>prastha</em> of honey.</p>
<p><em>Jologi</em> was the juice of the <em><a href="#khajj%C5%ABra">khajjūra</a></em> or the wild date palm and the <em>t</em><em>āla</em> either brewed or distilled. Whether <em>jologi</em> could be drunk by monks and nuns even before it had been fermented, was one of the points discussed during the Second Council <span class="ref">Vin.ii.294</span>. This debate probably concerned the fact that before palmyra or wild date juice is properly brewed, it spontaneously ferments within a few hours of being tapped, producing approximately 3% alcohol. Other types of alcoholic beverages were <em>kapotika</em><span class="ref">Vin.iv.109</span>, <em>madhu</em><span class="ref">S.i.212</span> and <em>varuni</em><span class="ref">A.iii.213</span>.</p>
<p>The Jātaka tells a legendary but plausible story of how alcohol was discovered. Long ago in a certain forest there was a fruit tree which had a large forked trunk with a depression in it. Rain water collected in the depression, fruit fell into it and warmed by the sun it fermented. In the summer, thirsty birds drank from the depression, became intoxicated, fell to the ground and after sleeping for a while, flew away. A hunter observed this and curious as to its cause, he too drank some of the liquid and became intoxicated. Later, he introduced this drink to his friends and so it was that alcohol became known. According to the Jātaka, this discovery opened the way for innumerable social ills <span class="ref">Ja.v.12-20</span>.
Concerning the consumption of alcohol, the Buddha said: “Whoever follows the Dhamma should not drink or encourage others to do so, knowing that intoxication is the result. Because of intoxication the fool commits evil deeds and makes others negligent too. So avoid this root of wrong, this folly loved only by fools” <span class="ref">Sn.398-9</span>.

Some of the different types of insects mentioned by the Buddha include those attracted to the smell of dung, those that live in dark places, others that live in rotting or putrid matter <span class="ref">M.iii.168</span> and still others, <em><a href="#adhip%C4%81ta">adhipāta</a></em>, that are attracted to lamps at night <span class="ref">Sn.964</span> <span class="ref">Ud.72</span>. Then there were various insects that monks and nuns living in the forest had to learn to endure; <em>ḍaṃsa</em>, a biting fly <span class="ref">M.i.10</span> and <em><a href="#andhaka">andhaka</a></em>, meaning “blind” <span class="ref">Sn.20</span>.

<p>Monks and nuns were expected to examine water before using it to make sure there were no tiny creatures in it, most of which would have been either insects or their larva, that might be injured or killed when the water was used <span class="ref">Vin.i.149</span>. The justification for the rule about not traveling during the rainy season was that in doing so a monk might kill some of the insects that proliferate and swarm during that time <span class="ref">Vin.136</span>. Scrupulousness towards tiny creatures came to be seen as a sign of the most sensitive compassion as is suggested by Ashvaghosa’s description of the Prince Siddhattha’s reaction to seeing plowing being done. “Clumps of grass turned up by the plow lay scattered on the ground and were covered with tiny dead creatures, insects and worms, and as he saw this he grieved as if one of his own kinsman had been killed” <span class="ref">Bc.5.5</span>.</p></dd></dl>

It has a gentle musical “<em>hoo popo</em>” call repeated sometimes for up to ten minutes at a time. In the Dīgha Nikāya, the hoopoe is mentioned together with several other birds that have pleasant calls <span class="ref">D.iii.202</span>.

Domestic chickens were kept for their eggs and meat. Cocks woke people early in the morning and cock fighting was a popular entertainment <span class="ref">D.i.6</span> <span class="ref">Ja.i.436</span>. The Buddha said that in the distant future villages would be so close together that a cock would be able to fly from one to the other <span class="ref">D.iii.75</span>. A hen might hatch a brood of eight or ten eggs and if she brooded them properly, warmed them properly and turned them properly, the chicks would safely break out of the shell using the claws on their feet and their beaks <span class="ref">A.iv.124</span>. When King Milinda expressed doubt to Nāgasena about the Buddha’s statement that the beginning of <em>saṃsāra</em> cannot be known, Nāgasena asked him in reply: “As an egg comes from a chicken and a chicken from an 
egg, is there an end to this series?” <span class="ref">Mil.51</span> This seems to be the earliest use of the well-known and popular “chicken and egg” dilemma.
The male red jungle fowl has glossy rufus and black plumage, a red comb and a long sickle-shaped tail. It has “wings that flash so gaily and a comb that droops so gracefully” <span class="ref">Ja.iii.265</span>. The hen has a light-brown breast, a dark-brown back and tail and a mottled neck.

This pathogen invades the nerves, skin and mucous membranes, causing insensitivity. White or pale patches appear on the skin, particularly on the hands and feet <span class="ref">Ja.v.69</span>.

Mahā Kassapa once ate the food from his bowl even though a finger of a leper who had offered him the food had fallen into it <span class="ref">Th.1016</span>. Once a “pathetic, poor, wrenched leper” named Suppabuddha stood at the edge of a crowd listening to the Buddha preach.

The Pāḷi name means “cocoon maker.”The silk worm constructs a cocoon when it is preparing to enter its chrysalis stage prior to becoming a moth.

Indian silk, called <em>koseyya</em>, was different from the Chinese mulberry type <span class="ref">A.i.181</span> <span class="ref">A.iv.394</span>. In India, the cocoons were collected from the wild and only after the worms had gnawed through them and thus the thread was not unraveled but carded and then spun into yarn. This meant that the cloth made from it was heavier and rougher than Chinese silk, although still beautiful and much-sought-after. To loosen the silk threads, cocoons had to be boiled and silk-making was a recognized trade <span class="ref">Vin.iii.224</span>. The famous brocade of Vārānasi which Prince Siddhattha wore before his renunciation, was made of silk <span class="ref">A.i.145</span>.

This species of crocodile differs from the better-known varieties by having a very long narrow snout often with a large fleshy nodule on the end. Gharials live in the tributaries of the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers and in small streams and ponds where they eat almost exclusively fish. Although fierce-looking and sometimes growing up to 7 m long, gharials never attack humans unless provoked. The Buddha said that a man seeing a pleasant-looking river might go for a swim and allow himself to be carried along with the current.

The first is light to dark-brown with paler tips to the feathers and pale brown below. It is a sociable and silent bird. The second is brownish-black with a whitish ruff at the base of the neck. It is a gregarious bird, roosting and nesting in groups and producing an occasional harsh screech. Both birds have naked heads and necks. The Jātaka mentions a spotted or variegated vulture although no bird fitting this description is found in India today <span class="ref">Ja.vi.106</span>. Vultures were often seen with dogs and jackals eating bodies in charnel grounds <span class="ref">Sn.201</span>.

The different types of domestic cattle recognized included suckling calves, <em>dhenupa</em>; yearlings, <em>taruṇavaccha</em>; milch cows, <em>dhenu</em> or <em>khīranikā</em>; red cows, <em>rohiṇī</em>; heifers, <em>vacchaka</em>; cows ready to be mated, <em>godharaṇī</em>; breeding cows <em>paveṇi</em>; bulls, <em>usabha</em>; oxen, <em>goṇa</em> and draught oxen, <em>balivadda</em> <span class="ref">A.ii.108</span> <span class="ref">M.i.226</span>. Cattle were of different colors - black, white, red, tawny, dappled and grey <span class="ref">A.iii.213</span>.</p>
<p>There is little evidence in the Tipiṭaka of cows being regarded with the universal reverence they were to be given in later Hinduism. The Buddha described cows as harmless creatures, gentle like sheep, who willingly give pails of milk <span class="ref">Sn.309</span>. He condemned Vedic sacrifice at which cattle were slaughtered. After being convinced by the Buddha of the cruelty and futility of such blood sacrifices the Brahmin Uggatasarīra released all the cattle he was about to slaughter with this benediction: “I hereby grant them life. Let them be fed with green grass, let them drink cool water, and let the cool breezes blow upon them”<span class="ref">D.i.148</span>. But for some people at least, beef was an ordinary part of their diet. We read of a butcher or his apprentice displaying a butchered cow for sale at a cross-road <span class="ref">M.i.58</span>. 
Leather, including that made out of cow hides, was used to make harnesses, bags, shields, mats, drums and water skins <span class="ref">Bv.1.31</span> <span class="ref">Ja.vi.431</span> <span class="ref">Vin.i.194</span> <span class="ref">Vin.ii.122</span>.

Leather working was a recognized craft although it was considered a low one <span class="ref">Vin.iv.6</span>.</p>
<p>Cattle were a symbol of wealth and to have many was a source of pride and joy <span class="ref">S.i.6</span>. Cattle rearing is mentioned together with accountancy, archery and royal service as a worthy occupation <span class="ref">M.i.85</span> <span class="ref">Vin.iv.6</span>. The five bounties of cows were milk, cream, butter milk, butter and ghee, this last one being considered the best <span class="ref">A.ii.94</span> <span class="ref">Vin.i.244</span>. The cowherd’s job was to take the animals out to graze and bring them back each evening <span class="ref">A.i.204</span>, pick the eggs of parasitic flies off them, dress their wounds and light smoking fires at night to protect them from mosquitoes <span class="ref">A.v.347</span>. During the growing season, watchmen had to make sure cows did not wander into the crops and eat them or tread them down <span class="ref">D.iii.38</span> <span class="ref">S.iv.195</span>.</p>
<p>Cattle wandered through the streets of towns and villages and could injure or even kill people <span class="ref">Ud.8</span>. Aggressive bulls sometimes had their horns cut off to prevent them from hurting anyone <span class="ref">A.iv.375</span>. Cattle were marked, probably by cutting, as is done today, rather than by branding, and according to Pāṇinī these marks should be made on either the ears or the rump. Bulls were castrated <span class="ref">Ja.iv.364</span> <span class="ref">Thi.440</span>. Cattle pulled ploughs and carts, their dung was smeared on the floor of homes <span class="ref">Vin.iii.15</span>, fed to pigs <span class="ref">D.iii.347</span>, used as a fuel <span class="ref">Ja.vi.508</span> and as a cleaning agent <span class="ref">S.iii.131</span>. A concoction of cow urine and yellow myrobalan was considered a cure for jaundice <span class="ref">Vin.i.205</span>.</p>
<p>Cattle also had a part to play in certain Brahmanical rituals. The Tipiṭaka describes a ceremony where the king would drink milk from a teat of a cow with a calf of the same color, the queen would drink milk from a second teat, the court Brahman from the third teat and milk from the fourth teat would be offered to the sacred fire <span class="ref">A.ii.207</span>. The torch used to ignite a person’s funeral pyre was smeared with cow dung <span class="ref">A.ii.94</span>, and Brahmans believed they could make themselves ritually pure by touching cow dung <span class="ref">A.v.265</span>. It was observed that if cows have cause to be frightened they would give less milk <span class="ref">Ja.i.388</span>.</p>

The Pāḷi name means “cow ear” while the Hindi name from which the English comes, means “blue bull”. Looking like a cross between a horse and a bull, the nilgai is India’s largest antelope. It has an iron-blue coat, high shoulders that slope down to a low rump and the male has short conical horns. The nilgai is most often seen at dusk lurking in the jungle bordering fields in preparation for raiding them when darkness falls. Because he stood aloof from debates, at least at some period of his career, the Buddha was accused of lacking the confidence to participate in such events. The ascetic Nigrodha said of him: “As a nilgai circling around keeps to the fringes, so does the monk Gotama” <span class="ref">D.iii.38</span>.</p></dd></dl>

<dd><p>Common Indian Monitor, Hindi <em>goh</em>, <em>Varanus bengalensis</em> <span class="ref">D.i.9</span>.

It lives comfortably in almost any environment and is commonly seen peering out of burrows in termite mounds and from between rocks. Although the Indian monitor is completely carnivorous, eating small animals, birds, eggs, insects and carrion, there is a reference to one eating figs <span class="ref">Ja.ii.118</span>. This belief may have arisen because the monitor is sometimes seen high in fig trees where it waits for birds. When termites would swarm after rain, monitors would dash about trying to catch them <span class="ref">Ja.ii.148</span>. Monitors were hunted, their flesh being considered a delicacy. Men would go into the forest with spades and dogs to track them down. They would light fires at the mouth of termite mounds to drive the monitors out and then 
catch and roast them <span class="ref">Ja.i.488</span> <span class="ref">Ja.iii.106</span>. According to the Jātakas, the Bodhisattva was once reborn as a monitor <span class="ref">Ja.ii.487</span>.</p></dd></dl>

<dd><p>Brahminy Shelduck, Hindi <em>chakwa</em>, <em>Tadorna ferruginea</em> <span class="ref">Ja.iii.520</span> <span class="ref">Ja.vi.189</span>, a large orange-brown duck, its head being slightly lighter in color and with black wing tips and tail. Shelducks are often seen in pairs or small flocks on river banks where they eat vegetation, mollusks, insects and fish. The Jātaka describes the shelduck as reddish in color, rounded in body and feeding off moss and green leaves <span class="ref">Ja.iv.70</span>. The compound <em>cakravāka</em> occurs in the <em>»g Veda</em> and mean something like “circle of sound”. Shelducks were probably given this name because pairs keep in touch at night by calling to each other. In later Indian literature the bird came to be associated with numerous virtues but especially with marital fidelity, although this gets no mention in the Tipiṭaka. However, the <em>Milindapañha</em> says: “As a shelduck never forsakes his mate as long as life lasts, even so, a meditator, an earnest student of meditation must not forsake clear 
comprehension for as lomg as life lasts” <span class="ref">Mil.401</span>.</p></dd></dl>
<dl><dt><dfn>Candana</dfn></dt>
<dd><p>Sandalwood. Both the Pāḷi and the English words are used loosely for a group of related trees that produce fragrant wood and oil. <em>Candana</em> refers primarily to <em>Santalum album</em> <span class="ref">Dhp.54</span>, a small-sized evergreen tree with a small pale flower gradually becoming crimson. The heartwood of this tree, called <em>haricandana</em>, ranges in color from whitish to yellowish and is strongly scented. The heartwood of the roots is even more so <span class="ref">J.i.146</span> <span class="ref">Vv.83.1</span>. The Tipiṭaka also refers to Red Sandalwood, (<em>lohita candana</em> or <em>rattacandana</em>), <em>Pterocarpus santainus</em> <span class="ref">A.iii.237</span> <span class="ref">A.v..22</span> <span class="ref">Ja.iv.442</span>. Both red and white sandalwood grow in the Deccan and South India and must have been imported into the north.</p>
<p>Sandalwood had many uses. It was pulverized and smeared on the body as a perfume and for its supposed cooling properties <span class="ref">Thi.145</span> <span class="ref">Thi.267</span>. The paste was made by grinding a piece of wood on a stone <span class="ref">Ja.iv.440</span>. Being soft, fine-grained and easy to carve it was made into luxury objects <span class="ref">A.i.9</span>. We read that a wealthy merchant had a bowl carved out of sandalwood. He even kept the off-cuts to use for other purposes <span class="ref">Vin.i.109</span>. The Buddha said that when he was a prince he used only sandalwood from Vārānasi <span class="ref">A.i.145</span>. Powered sandalwood (<em>candanacuṇṇa</em>) was sometimes rubbed dry on the body or burned as an incense, and it is said that sandalwood powder fell from the sky just before the Buddha’s final Nirvāna at Kusinārā <span class="ref">D.ii.137</span>.</p>
<p>The early Buddhists frequently equated sandalwood with things thought of as virtuous or holy. “Just as a man who came across a piece of yellow or red sandalwood and he smelled it at the root, in the middle or at the top he would experience a beautiful, sweet and pleasant fragrance, even so, when one hears the good Gotama’s Dhamma in all its parts one experiences elation and joy” <span class="ref">A.iii.237</span>. The <em>Milindapañha</em> compared Nirvāna to the precious and rare red sandalwood. “As red sandalwood is hard to obtain, even so, Nirvāna is hard to obtain. Again, red sandalwood is unequalled for its lovely fragrance,even so is Nirvāna unequalled for its lovely fragrance.Yet again, red sandalwood is praised by good people; even so is Nirvāna praised by the Noble Ones. These are the three special qualities of red sandalwood that are present in Nirvāna.<span class="ref">Mil.321</span></p>
<p>Xuanzang was told this tale concerning the harvesting of sandalwood and a tree similar to it. “In the south of this country (Malakūta), bordering the sea, are the Malaya Mountains, remarkable for their high peaks and precipices, their deep valleys and mountain torrents. Here is found the white sandalwood tree and the <em>candaneva</em> tree. These two are much alike and the latter can only be distinguished by going in the height of summer to the top of some hill and then looking at a great distance great serpents may be seen entwining it; thus it is known. Its wood is naturally cold and therefore serpents twine round it. After having noted the tree, they shoot an arrow into it to mark it. In the winter after the snakes have gone, the tree is cut down.” Similar stories about where sandlewood grows and the serpants or dragons that live around it are to be found in Sanskrit works such as the <em>Amarakośa</em> and the <em>Kāvyamīmāṃsā</em>.</p></dd>

The same size as the house sparrow, this bird is pale brown with chestnut shoulder patches, two white bars on its wings and a yellow throat. It lives in lightly forested country in the neighborhood of villages and feeds on paddy left over after the harvest, grass seeds, berries, nectar and insects. The call of the yellow-throated sparrow is similar to that of the house sparrow but more pleasant.

Being the main staple in northern India, the Tipiṭaka contains much information about the cultivation of rice. Paddy fields were square or rectangular and had embankments around them <span class="ref">Ja.iv.167</span> <span class="ref">Vin.i.391</span>. A good paddy field had to be level, have deep fertile soil, a reliable water supply, an inlet and outlet for the water and sturdy embankments around it <span class="ref">A.iv.237</span>. There is mention of ponds or lakes, either natural or man-made, being near paddy fields or of them being situated near rivers <span class="ref">A.iii.26</span> <span class="ref">Ja.iii.293</span> <span class="ref">Ja.iv.167</span> <span class="ref">Ja.v.35</span>, and we read of hollow tree trunks being used as irrigation pipes <span class="ref">A.iv.170</span>. Farmers would indicate which fields were theirs with marker stones <span class="ref">Ja.iv.281</span>. To get a good yield the seed had to be unbroken, capable of sprouting and then well-watered <span class="ref">A.i.135</span>. It was believed that rice seeds would absorb the essence of the earth and water and that this would determine its taste <span class="ref">A.v.212</span>. Few of the implements used in agriculture, including rice 
cultivation, are mentioned in the Tipiṭaka, amongst them the plough (<em>naṅgola</em>) with its iron-tipped plough share (<em>phālapācana</em>), the hoe or spade (<em>kuḍḍāla</em>), the sickle (<em>tiṇalāyana asi</em>) and a tool sometimes translated as a weeding hook (<em>niddāna</em>, <span class="ref">A.i.204</span> <span class="ref">Ja.v.45</span> <span class="ref">Sn.77-8</span>). A ceremony called <em>vappamaṅgala</em> was conducted just before the first plowing in the belief that it would guarantee a good harvest <span class="ref">Ja.i.57</span> <span class="ref">Ja.iv.167</span>.</p>
<p>The growing rice had to be protected from cattle straying into it and from wild birds and animals eating it. The ripening crop was sometimes attacked by a disease called <em><a href="#seta%E1%B9%AD%E1%B9%ADhika">setaṭṭhika</a></em> <span class="ref">A.iv.278</span>. The process of harvesting consisted of reaping the rice, gathering it up, tying it into sheaves to dry, treading it out, winnowing it and then threshing it <span class="ref">A.i.241</span>. The grains were loosened from the stalks by driving cattle over it <span class="ref">Th.1</span> or by beating it out with flails <span class="ref">S.iv.201</span>. The winnowing was done by dropping the grain from a height and allowing the wind to separate the grain from the chaff. The harvesters would take care to keep the grain and the chaff separate and use a broom to sweep them apart <span class="ref">A.iv.169</span>. Alternatively, sometimes winnowing baskets shaped like an elephants” ear were used to fan the grain from the chaff and then to remove grit <span class="ref">Ud.68</span>. After the harvest the rice was stored in a granary <span class="ref">Vin.i.240</span> and every now and then it would be taken out to be aired <span class="ref">Vin.i.211</span>.

<p>
Plain boiled rice was called <em>odana</em> or <em>bhatta</em> and was usually eaten with various curries and condiments <span class="ref">A.iv.230</span>. The rich would have the blackened grains removed from their rice <span class="ref">A.iv.230</span> while the poor might be reduced to eating even the scum formed by cooking rice <span class="ref">A.i.241</span> <span class="ref">Ja.ii.289</span>. Bran, (<em><a href="#ka%E1%B9%87a">kaṇa</a></em>, <em><a href="#kukkusa">kukkusa</a></em> or <em>kuṇḍaka</em>), the brown covering of grains removed during polishing or milling, was considered the most humble of foods and was made into cakes and gruel <span class="ref">D.i.166</span> <span class="ref">Ja.i.423</span>. People considered milled and polished white rice to be superior to unmilled brown rice. A guest in the Jātaka noticed that at the beginning of his stay his host served him white rice but as time progressed it became brown, indicating that he had outstayed his welcome <span class="ref">Ja.v.233</span>.</p>
<p>Rice was sometimes cooked together with sesame seeds <span class="ref">Ja.iii.425</span>. <em>Kaṇājaka</em> was a porridge made from the broken grains that had been removed while cleaning the rice <span class="ref">Ja.v.230</span>. A porridge of rice boiled in milk was called <em>khīrodana</em> <span class="ref">Vv.33.24</span> or <em>pāyāsa</em> <span class="ref">Ja.iv.391</span> <span class="ref">S.i.166</span>. An idiom said that a loving couple were as inseparable as ghee mixed into <em>pāyāsa</em>, which must have been another way of serving this porridge <span class="ref">Ja.i.457</span>.A feature of various auspicious occasions was to scatter grains of popped rice (<em>lajja</em>) together with flower petals of different colors <span class="ref">Ja.ii.240</span> <span class="ref">Ja.vi.42</span>. A confectionary called <em>madulāja</em> was madeof balls of popped rice held together with molasses<span class="ref">Ja.iii.539</span> <span class="ref">Ja.iv.214</span>. A gruel called <em>yāgu</em> <span class="ref">A.iii.50</span> <span class="ref">D.i.76</span> <span class="ref">M.i.247</span> was probably made as it is today by boiling rice in water to a thin consistency and adding salt, a garlic clove and a few pepper corns. The Buddha said there were five benefits of this rice gruel; it dispels hunger, 
quenches thirst, regulates wind, cleanses the bowels and it helps digest the remnants of food <span class="ref">A.iii.249</span>. Another type of gruel was called <em>bilanga</em> <span class="ref">Vin.ii.77</span>. A type of alcoholic beverage was prepared from cooked rice with yeast added <span class="ref">Vin.iv.109</span>. A preparation called <em>thālīpāka</em> was made, according to the <em>Gūhya Sūtra</em>, of either rice or barley cooked with either milk or water and was used as an offering to the gods. After being offered this food was eaten <span class="ref">A.i.166</span> <span class="ref">D.i.97</span> <span class="ref">S.ii.242</span>.</p>
<p>The Nidānakathā gives the recipe for a rice dish called <em>gavapāna</em>. To make it, one boiled milk until it thickened, added rice a little at a time, then added a cooked mixture of honey, palm sugar, flour and ghee and then let it simmer until the rice was soft <span class="ref">Ja.i.33</span>. In several places in the Tipiṭaka women are dismissed as having a “two-fingered wit” <span class="ref">S.i.129</span>. According to the commentary, this refers to the housewives” habit of squeezing grains of boiling rice between the thumb and first finger to see if it is cooked.

The round yellow fruit appears in large bunches. The leaves of the palmyra were used to make huts, fans, sunshades and various household articles <span class="ref">Th.127</span>. The sap of the male flower was used to make an alcoholic beverage called <em>jalogi</em>. Whether or not it was allowable for monks and nuns to drink unfermented <em>jalogi</em> was discussed at the Second Council <span class="ref">Vin.ii.294</span>. When reduced by boiling, this sap also made a gritty brown sugar which was called <em>sakkharā</em> <span class="ref">Ja.i.251</span> <span class="ref">Ja.i.348</span>.

More than a dozen species of grass are mentioned in the Tipiṭaka. The Buddha said that a monk or nun should not steal anything, not even a blade of grass <span class="ref">Vin.i.97</span>. Various useful items were made out of grass. We read of grass mats <span class="ref">Vin.i.286</span> and of houses being thatched with grass <span class="ref">A.i.101</span>.

This probably refers to the Terai-Duar grasslands ecoregion on the northern edge of the Ganges Valley. The Buddha required his monks and nuns to stay put during the monsoon so that they would not tread down crops and grass and injure the tiny creatures that lived among them <span class="ref">Vin.i.137</span> The Buddha mentioned that on retiring to the forest for meditation he

The north Indian bird with the most stick-like legs is the Black-necked Stork, <em>Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus</em>, a large bird with a black head, neck and back, white wings and belly, long bright red legs and a massive black beak. Solitary birds are often seen in marshes and shallow ponds where they eat fish, crustaceans and frogs.

Grains like wheat and barley have a awn (<em><a href="#s%C4%81ka">sāka</a></em>) at the end of the husk. Sometimes rice or barley was cooked and then dried, probably to preserve it. Once, during a famine, some monks were given such food which was meant to feed horses. They pounded it in a mortar and then ate it <span class="ref">Vin.iii.6</span>. During various auspicious occasions grains of popped rice or wheat (<em><a href="#l%C4%81ja">lāja</a></em>) together with flower petals of different colors would be scattered <span class="ref">Ja.ii.240</span> <span class="ref">Ja.vi.42</span>.

An alert creature with an elongated body, short legs and tawny grey fur, the mongoose is famous for eating snakes although it also hunts birds, rats and insects. Mongoose were captured and trained to fight snakes for entertainment or to find and kill those that invaded homes. They are a cautious creature and go stealthily when they see humans <span class="ref">A.v.289</span>. Indians have long believed that before hunting snakes mongoose eat certain herbs as an antidote against venom. Nāgasena said: “As a mongoose approaches a snake to seize it only after having supplied its own body with medicine, so too the meditator, the earnest student of meditation, on approaching this world abounding as it is in anger and malice, plagued by quarrels, strife, contention and hatred, must anoint his mind with the medicine of love” <span class="ref">Mil.394</span>.

<dd><p>Cobra, Hindi <em>nag</em>, large snakes of the family Elapidae which are capable of flattening the long ribs in their necks into a hood when threatened.

When referring to the cobra the common words for snakes, <em>āsīvisa</em> <span class="ref">Ja.ii.274</span>, <em><a href="#sappa">sappa</a></em> <span class="ref">Ja.vi.6</span> and <em>nāga</em> <span class="ref">Ja.vi.166</span> are used together with the comment that it has a hood, suggesting that the cobra was also known as “the hooded snake”. Snake charmers were a feature of street life in cities and towns <span class="ref">Ja.iii.198</span> and they usually used cobras because of their impressive appearance, their ability to stand erect and their tendency to follow and therefore appear to dance to the moving flute played by the charmer. These charmers were believed to use special herbs and magic spells to mesmerize cobras in order to attract and then catch them. They would approach the snake, seize it by the tail, drag it backwards so that it would be stretched out 
full length and then use what was called a “goat’s foot stick” to pin its head down. Seizing it by the head and applying pressure to the sides would force the cobra’s mouth open so the charmer could spit the juice of certain herbs into it which would, it was believed, break its fangs. Over the next few days the cobra would be subjected to a series of procedures meant to pacify it and get it used to being handled. These procedures were called <em>cuṇṇamāna</em>, <em>tantamajjita</em> and <em>dussapoṭhima</em> and seem to have involved wrapping the cobra in cloth and then stretching, squeezing, massaging and striking it. After this the cobra was ready to be used <span class="ref">Ja.iv.457</span>. During their performances, charmers would make cobras dance and drape them around their necks <span class="ref">Ja.i.370</span>. They would feed them with frogs they had killed <span class="ref">Ja.vi.458</span>. The species of cobra favored by charmers has always been the nocturnal Indian Cobra, <em>Naja naja</em>, because daylight hampers its ability to strike. See

The banyan is famous for growing up against other trees and eventually strangling them. The Jātaka described a bird eating banyan figs, later dropping its excrement in the fork of a flame of the forest tree where the banyan seeds germinated, put forth red shoots and foliage and eventually strangled the tree <span class="ref">Ja.iii.208</span>. The Buddha said that craving is like the trunk of the banyan that clings to and eventually envelops the things it comes into contact with <span class="ref">S.i.207</span>. He also said that passions come to oneself just as the aerial roots (<em>khandahaya</em>) of the banyan are “trunk-sprung” <span class="ref">Sn.272</span>. The figs, which are red and grow on the branches, could be as sweet as sugar <span class="ref">Ja.iii.110</span>.</p>
<p>During the Buddha’s stay at Bodh Gaya, he spent seven days sitting at the foot of the Goatherd’s Banyan Tree <span class="ref">Ud.3</span>. Once, he compared the kind, generous and believing lay man to a banyan tree. “Just as in some pleasant countryside where four roads meet the great banyan tree is a haven of rest for all the birds; even so the believing lay man is a haven of rest for many, for monks and nuns, for lay men and lay women” <span class="ref">A.iii.42</span>. A popular place near Kapilavatthu, the Buddha’s hometown, was the Banyan Park, perhaps named after a large banyan tree that grew there <span class="ref">A.v.82</span>. People would make vows before banyan trees, offering them flowers and perfume, watering them and reverently walking around them <span class="ref">Ja.i.259</span> and hence their alternative name “Vow Tree” (<em><a href="#vararukkha">vararukkha</a></em>, <span class="ref">Ja.i.259</span>). One of the 32 characteristics of the Mahāpurisa’s body is that it has the proportions of a banyan tree, i.e. the length of his arm is equal to his height <span class="ref">D.ii.18</span>. The previous Buddha Kassapa was enlightened under a banyan

<p>In India today, country folk use neem twigs to clean their teeth in the morning, chewing the twig until it frays and then rubbing it up and down over their teeth. The Buddha recommended using a tooth stick because it keeps the eyes clear, purifies the sinuses, sweetens the breath, cleans the taste buds, prevents phlegm and mucus getting in the food and makes food more tasty <span class="ref">A.iii.249</span>. However, he does not say what type of wood the tooth stick should be made from. See <strong><a href="#tamb%C5%ABla">Tambūla</a></strong>.</p></dd>

Birds are feathered, egg-laying bipeds of the class Aves. Numerous kinds of birds are mentioned in the Tipiṭaka but not all of these can be identified. However, birds in general are frequently referred to. In the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> birds are classified as either peckers, scratchers, aquatic or birds of prey, although no attempt is made in the Tipiṭaka to classify them. Birds leave no track as they fly through the sky <span class="ref">Dhp.92</span>. They flock to big banyan trees to roost, eat the fruit and rest in the shade <span class="ref">A.iii.42</span> <span class="ref">A.iii.304</span>. They have beautiful songs; “peacocks scream, herons cry and koels gently warble” <span class="ref">D.iii.201</span>. The call of some birds sounded to the Indian 
ear like words, a point made by the grammarian Yāska. The <em>jīvaṃjīvaka’s</em> cry sounded like “Live!” (<em>Jīva</em>) and another bird seemed to say “lift up your hearts”(<em>utthehi citte</em>, <span class="ref">D.iii.201</span>). The monk Rāmaṇeyyaka said that the chirping and twittering of the birds in the forest did not disturb his meditation <span class="ref">Th.49</span>. Whether in the forest or at the edge of the village, the bird songs always gave delight. The Jātaka says: “Around and about the trees can be heard the chorus of flocks of <em><a href="#najjuh%C4%81">najjuhā</a></em> birds and cuckoos as they fly from one tree to another. Amongst the branches and foliage they sing to passers-by and delight both newcomers and locals” <span class="ref">Ja.vi.534</span>. It was observed that birds like peacocks and pigeons sometimes eat pebbles or grit <span class="ref">Mil.67</span>. Seafarers took birds with them on their voyages and would release them when they sailed out of sight of land. If the bird returned to the ship they would know they were still far from land <span class="ref">D.i.222</span>.</p>
<p>The Buddha said that just as a bird flies off taking only its wings with it, monks or nuns should wander taking only a few simple possessions with them <span class="ref">D.i.71</span>. A god once told a monk that just as a bird removes dust from itself after a dust bath with a vigorous shake, an ardent mindful monk should flick off the dust of the defilements <span class="ref">S.i.197</span>. Birds like domestic fowl, quails and partridges were eaten and “rice with well-dressed fowl” was a popular dish <span class="ref">Sn.241</span>. Feathers were used to make fans and flights for arrows. Peacock feathers were used for decorative purposes, and the <span class="FontFamilyTimesExtRomanTimesNewRomanSerif">quills</span>of some feathers were used as sewing needles <span class="ref">Vin.ii.215</span> and to store things in. Some ascetics had cloaks made out of the feathers of certain birds. Domestic fowl and their eggs were an important part of people’s diets. Wild birds like quails and pigeons were hunted for food and their eggs were collected. Hawks were trained to hunt <span class="ref">Ja.v.275</span>
. People put baskets in trees and under eaves for birds to nest in <span class="ref">Ja.i.242</span>.

<dd><p>Sacred Lotus, also known as <em><a href="#ambuja">ambuja</a></em> “water born”, <em>bhisa</em>, <em><a href="#kamala">kamala</a></em>, <em>paduminī</em>, <em>pokkhara</em>, <em>saroruha</em>, <em>muḷālipuppha</em> or <em><a href="#v%C4%81rija">vārija</a></em>, “water born”, <em>Nelumbo necifera</em> <span class="ref">D.i.75</span> <span class="ref">Ja.i.146</span> <span class="ref">S.i.204</span> <span class="ref">Sn.2</span> <span class="ref">Th.1089</span>. The lotus is a perennial aquatic herb with large, round pastel-green leaves which sometimes float on the surface of the water or rise above it and with prickly stems <span class="ref">Sn.845</span>. Lotus blossoms can be pink or white and were named <em>kokāsaka</em> or <em>kumuda</em> <span class="ref">Dhp.285</span> <span class="ref">D.ii.179</span> and <em>kokanada</em> or <em><a href="#pu%E1%B9%87%E1%B8%8Dar%C4%ABka">puṇḍarīka</a></em> <span class="ref">A.iii.239</span> <span class="ref">S.i.81</span> respectively. Five hues of white were also discerned <span class="ref">Ja.i.281</span>. It seems that the word <em>paduma</em> was sometimes used loosely enough to include the Blue Water Lily, <em>Nymphea caerulra</em>. This is clear from the fact that the Buddha mentions <em>paduma</em> as being white, pink or blue <span class="ref">A.i.145</span>. As there is no blue lotus this must refer to the blue water lily, 
more commonly called <em><a href="#uppala">uppala</a></em> in Pāḷi.</p>
<p>Lotuses grew in the wild but were also planted in bathing tanks and garden ponds for beautification. When in Campa, the Buddha would stay at one such tank, Gaggarā’s Lotus Lake <span class="ref">D.i.111</span>. Such ponds, whether natural or man-made are described as being full of cool, sweet and clear water and lotus blossoms of different colors <span class="ref">S.i.138</span> <span class="ref">Vin.i.5</span>. When still a bodhisattva, the Buddha had three palaces, each with a pond of blue water lilies and pink and white lotuses <span class="ref">A.i.145</span>. The lotus has a sweet subtle perfume although it is hard to say whether this comes from the petals, the stem or the pistils <span class="ref">S.iii.130</span>. In one delightful story, a monk who waded into a lotus pool to bathe and smell the flowers was chided by a god for being a “smell thief” <span class="ref">S.i.204</span>. Comely young men or women were described as having “an excellent lotus-like beauty” <span class="ref">A.iii.90</span> <span class="ref">A.iii.152</span> and a sincere and generous layman was described as “the lotus of laity” <span class="ref">A.iii.206</span>. People would make garlands out of lotus blossoms and also eat the stems 
and roots <span class="ref">Ja.iii.308</span> and a drink was made from the juice extracted from the root <span class="ref">Vin.i.246</span>. Moggallāna is described as collecting lotus roots and stalks to make them into a medicine for fever <span class="ref">Vin.i.215</span>. Lotus nectar was also drunk <span class="ref">Ja.v.466</span> and the leaves were used to make holders and to wrap food in <span class="ref">S.v.438</span>.</p>
<p>There are several things about the lotus that seem to have fascinated the Buddha and were often mentioned by him. The first was that such a beautiful pure flower emerges from dirty muddy water. To him, this was analogous to the enlightened person’s transcendence of <em>saṃsāra</em>. “Just as the lotus is born in the water and grows up beneath the water, yet remains undefiled by the water, fragrant and beautiful. Just so, the Buddha is born in the world, grows up and dwells in the world but like the lotus unstained by the water, he is not defiled by the world” <span class="ref">A.iii.346</span> <span class="ref">S.iii.140</span> <span class="ref">Sn.71</span> <span class="ref">Th.700-1</span>. The second thing was the fact that water will not adhere to the lotus leaf. Because of microscopic waxy papillae on the surface of the leaf water splashed on it turns into quicksilver-like drops and immediately slips off, leaving no trace of moisture. “Whoever in the world overcomes this low unruly craving, sorrow falls away like drops of water on a lotus leaf” <span class="ref">Dhp.336</span> <span class="ref">Dhp.401</span>.

The fruit is as large as a pumpkin. When it is ripe it is of a yellowish-red color. When divided it has in the middle many tens of little fruits of the size of a pigeon’s egg.

<dd><p>Flower, also <em>kusuma</em>. Flowers are the reproductive structures of Angiosperms, flowering plants. Some of the components of flowers mentioned in the Tipiṭaka include the stem (<em>daṇḍa</em> or <em>vaṇṭa</em>), buds (<em>koraka</em>), petals (<em><a href="#pa%E1%B9%AD%E1%B9%ADa">paṭṭa</a></em> or <em>dala</em>), calyx (<em>gabbha</em>), filament (<em>kiñjakkha</em>) pericarp (<em>kaṇṇikā</em>) and the pollen (<em>reṇu</em>). Flowers were said to be of two types, those growing on land and those growing in the water, although sometimes a third type is added; those growing on creepers <span class="ref">Ja.i.51</span> <span class="ref">Vv.35.6</span>.</p>
<p>The ancient Indians had a deep appreciation for flowers; they wore them in their hair, as garlands around their necks,used them to flavor their food and drinks and offered them to their gods. Flowers were associated with auspicious events. The Nidānakathā describes how all the plants in the universe burst into flower as the Buddha attained enlightenment. “Flowering trees in the ten thousand world-systems sprung into bloom and fruit-bearing trees were weighed down with bunches of fruit. Flowers that blossom on tree trunk, branches and vines did so each in their respective places. Lotuses on stalks broke through the rocky crust and arose in bunches of seven and were heaped together layer upon layer”<span class="ref">Ja.i.76</span>.
On Uposatha days, Buddhists would abstain from wearing perfume, makeup and garlands <span class="ref">A.iv.250</span>. The Buddha said that flowers, incense and colored paste should be offered to shrines <span class="ref">D.ii.142</span> and people were employed to clear flowers from such shrines <span class="ref">Ja.v.449</span> <span class="ref">Th.620</span>. A part of the betrothal ceremony consisted of bedecking the bride with garlands <span class="ref">M.i.286</span> and the making of garlands was a recognized craft <span class="ref">Ja.v.292</span>. <em>Kinnara</em>, mythical creatures with a bird’s body and a human head were believed to dress in flowers, eat pollen and entertain themselves by swinging on creepers <span class="ref">Ja.iv.283</span>. The Vinaya mentions a variety of garlands, wreaths and bouquets, although the differences between these are not clear <span class="ref">Vin.iii.179</span>. Horticulture was in its infancy, but we do read of royal pleasure gardens surrounded by walls and staffed by guards and gardeners <span class="ref">Ja.i.50</span>. Alcoholic drinks were made out of or flavored with certain flowers <span class="ref">Ja.iv.117</span> <span class="ref">Vin.i.246</span> <span class="ref">Vin.iv.109</span>. The Buddha often used flowers as similes in 
his talks and sayings. For example: “Just as many garlands can be made from a heap of flowers, so too many good deeds can be done by one born human.” <span class="ref">Dhp.53</span>. “Like a flower that is beautiful but has no scent is the exhortation of one who speaks but does not act accordingly.” <span class="ref">Dhp.51</span> Someone who spoke pleasantly was said to “speak flowers” <span class="ref">Pp.29</span>.</p></dd></dl>

<dd><p>Seed. A seed is a new plant in the form of an embryo. Some of the parts of seeds mentioned in the Tipiṭaka include the husk (<em>thusa</em>), the kernel (<em>miñja</em>), and in the case of germinating seeds, the sprout or shoot (<em>aṅkura</em>). The seeds of certain plants are encased in a pod (<em>sipāṭaka</em> or <em>kuṭṭhilika</em>). In order to germinate a seed has to have an intact casing, be fresh, be unspoiled by wind or heat and be sown in a good field with properly prepared soil <span class="ref">A.i.135</span>. Some seeds have hard shells that crack only if burned and it was noticed that new shoots often appear quickly after a forest fire <span class="ref">S.i.69</span>. The two factors that enable a seed to grow are nutrition from the soil (<em>paṭhavi rasa</em>) and moisture <span class="ref">S.i.134</span>. Whether the leaves or fruit of the plant is sweet or bitter was believed to depend not on the nutrition but on the nature of the seed <span class="ref">A.i.32</span>. Commenting on the endless cycle of agriculture the monk Kāḷudāyin said: “Again and again 
they sow the seed; again and again the god king rains; again and again farmers plough the fields; again and yet again the country has grain” <span class="ref">Th.532</span>. The seven types of edible seeds usually mentioned in the Tipiṭaka are <em><a href="#s%C4%81li">sāli</a></em>, <em><a href="#v%C4%ABhi">vīhi</a></em>, <em><a href="#mugga">mugga</a></em>, <em><a href="#m%C4%81sa">māsa</a></em>, <em><a href="#tila">tila</a></em> and <em><a href="#ta%E1%B9%87%E1%B8%8Dula">taṇḍula</a></em> <span class="ref">M.i.457</span>.

When dried the root of this grass, called <em><a href="#us%C4%ABra">usīra</a></em> in Pāḷi, gives off a pleasant fragrance. The Buddha mentioned the fine fibers of the <em><a href="#us%C4%ABra">usīra</a></em> root <span class="ref">A.i.204</span> and recommended the root itself as a medicine <span class="ref">Vin.i.201</span>.

The <em>Mahāvastu</em> describes a maiden as having a complexion like <em><a href="#us%C4%ABra">usīra</a></em>, probably referring to the fresh root’s delicate pink color <span class="ref">Mv.ii.59</span>. The Buddha said: “This I say to you, sirs, who are gathered here; dig up the root of craving as one seeking the <em><a href="#us%C4%ABra">usīra</a></em> digs up <em>bīraṇa</em> grass” <span class="ref">Dhp.337</span>.</p></dd></dl>

Numerous species of mosquitoes are found in northern India including nine species of Anopheles mosquito known to carry malaria. Mosquitoes were one of the many things forest-living monks and nuns had to learn to live with. The monk Gahvaratīriya urged a patient endurance to such biting insects. “Annoyed by flies and mosquitoes in the forest, in the great jungle, be like an elephant in the thick of the battle and endure mindfully”<span class="ref">Th.31</span>. The affliction called “snake-wind-disease” (<em>ahivātakaroga</em>) is thought by some modern scholars to have been malaria <span class="ref">Vin.i.77</span>. The Saṃyutta Nikāya mentions a man “whose testicles were like pots” <span class="ref">S.ii.258</span>, a common symptom of filariasis. There is also a reference to people suffering from elephantiasis, (<em>sīpada</em>, <span class="ref">Vin.i.91</span>). Both diseases are caused by 
<em>Wuchereria bancrofti</em>, <em>Brugia malayi</em> and several other species of roundworm transmitted by mosquitoes.
People protected themselves from mosquitoes by sleeping under nets <span class="ref">Vin.ii.119</span> and protected their flocks from them by lighting smoldering fires <span class="ref">Ja.iii.401</span>.

Macaques live in close proximity to humans and are often seen in cities, especially around temples, where they eat flower and food offerings. Commenting on the rapidly changing nature of consciousness the Buddha said:“Just as a macaque moving through the trees grabs one branch and lets it go only to seize another, so too that which is called thought, mind or consciousness arises and disappears continually both day and night” <span class="ref">S.ii.9</span> <span class="ref">S.ii.5</span>. The monk Valliya compared the body to a five-doored house and the mind to a macaque racing around inside it. Then he cried to himself: “Be still, macaque, stop running. Things are not as they were before. Now you are restrained with wisdom”<span class="ref">Th.125-6</span>. Baby macaques were sometimes kept as pets and adults were trained by street entertainers.

Fish are aquatic cold-blooded vertebrates usually covered with scales. Numerous types of fish are found in the rivers and ponds of northern India, many of them edible. However, only a few of those mentioned in the Tipiṭaka can be identified. Fishing was an occupation, although fishermen were despised together with butchers, fowlers, hunters, robbers, murderers, jailers and others “who follow a blood-soaked work” <span class="ref">A.iii.383</span>.

Apparently it was often consumed together with alcohol <span class="ref">Ja.i.349-350</span> <span class="ref">Ja.iii.435</span>. Fish were caught in nets, traps, hooked lines or were sometimes speared <span class="ref">Ja.i.427</span>, and fish was eaten fresh or dried <span class="ref">Ja.i.349</span>. When fishermen caught fish they would throw them onto the sand and later spit them and roast them in hot embers <span class="ref">Ja.ii.178</span>. We read of fish in a garden pond 
coming to be fed at the sound of a drum <span class="ref">Ja.ii.227</span>. Fish sense when a drought is coming and try to swim out of their ponds <span class="ref">Ja.ii.80</span>.</p>
<p>According to the commentary of the Vimānavatthu, one of the gates of Vārānasi was called the Fisherman’s Gate, probably because it opened on the river where fishermen worked or sold their catch <span class="ref">Vv-a.19</span>. The Buddha compared the way thoughts flit through the mind to the thrashing of a fish when pulled out of the water <span class="ref">Dhp.34</span>. Once he scolded some noisy monks, saying that they sounded like fishermen pulling in a good catch <span class="ref">A.iii.30</span>. Fish were sometimes used in idioms of the time. A devious person was said to be as unknowable as “the course of fish in the water” <span class="ref">Ja.i.295</span>, and to “be tongueless like a fish” meant to be taciturn <span class="ref">Ja.vi.295</span>.

<p>One Jātaka story mentions a gold-colored fish <span class="ref">Ja.iv.335</span> which must be a reference to the Golden Barb, <em>Puntius achsii</em>. This fish is golden-colored with silver highlights and has a distinct black spot on the base of its tail. Growing up to 8 cm long the golden barb is found in the standing waters of rivers and in lakes and ponds with silty bottoms where it feeds on small crustaceans and insects. Indian peasants consider the golden barb to be an auspicious creature and it is also a popular aquarium fish. Another type of fish mentioned without being named is one with a human-body, a razor-like nose and which leaps in and out of the sea <span class="ref">Ja.iv.139</span>.

Frogs are amphibians of the order Salientia of which about 190 species live in India. Frogs have long hind legs adapted for jumping, large heads with protruding eyes and usually live in or near water. The most common and easily seen frog in northern India is the Skittering Frog, <em>Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis</em>. This medium-sized smooth-skinned frog is gray, brown or blackish, often with darker spots and a black belly. It is usually seen on the side of ponds and puddles or floating contentedly on the surface. When alarmed, it skitters over the surface, sometimes for a considerable distance, then dives and buries itself in the mud. The skittering frog is seen in all seasons and eats insects and small vertebrates.</p>

In his poem in praise of the Ajakaraṇī River, the monk Sappaka mentioned the deep-throated croaking of the frogs <span class="ref">Th.310</span>. When told that people could wash away their sins by bathing in sacred rivers, the nun Puṇṇikā quipped that if this were so then all the turtles, crocodiles and frogs would go to heaven <span class="ref">Thi.341</span>. Once, a group of people sat listening to the Buddha preach and a frog, attracted by the sound of his voice, joined the audience. The frog was accidentally crushed by a cowherd’s stick and was afterwards reborn in a heaven realm <span class="ref">Vv.51.2</span>. Unripe fruit was said to be “as green as a frog” <span class="ref">Ja.vi.529</span> and snakes were sometimes called “frog eaters” <span class="ref">Ja.iii.16</span>.

The Honey Tree is particularly useful although it is very slow growing and only rarely cultivated. The wood is good and strong, the fleshy corollas of the flower are sun dried and eaten and a sweet spirit can be made from them. It was probably this drink that the Buddha forbade monks and nuns to take <span class="ref">Vin.i.246</span>.

There are three main species of bee native to northern India, the Rock Bee or <em><a href="#bhamara">bhamara</a></em> and the Little Bee, which are both wild, and the Indian Hive Bee, <em>Apis indica</em>, which is domesticated. Honey was a much sought-after food.

The male has a beautiful blue-green neck, breast and tail and chestnut brown wings. Peafowl keep together in small flocks, roost in trees at night and have loud “<em>may-aw</em>” call which can be heard over a long distance. The early morning cry of the “beautiful blue-necked and crested peacock” would wake sleeping monks <span class="ref">Th.22</span>. They are “fair-crested, fair-winged, with beautiful blue neck, fair-faced and have a beautiful song and a fine cry” <span class="ref">Th.211</span>. The color of the peacock’s neck was compared with that of beryl <span class="ref">Ja.i.207</span>. Fly whisks were made out of peacocks feathers <span class="ref">Vv.33.44</span> and Indian magicians have always used peacock feather fans as their wands. The Buddha compared lay people with the peacock and monks with the goose. The first 
is beautifully adorned but a clumsy flier, while the second is drab-colored but can fly with ease <span class="ref">Sn.221</span>. In the Bamboo Grove at Rājagaha, there was a place where people came to feed the peafowl.

This stout yellow, light-green and grey bird has a lilac patch on its shoulders and yellow stripes on its black wings. A gregarious bird, it is often found in large numbers in banyan and Bodhi trees trees eating the figs.

<dd><p>Camel’s Foot Creeper, Hindi <em>malu</em>, <em>Bauhinia vahlii</em>, the largest creeper in the Indian forest <span class="ref">Dhp162</span> <span class="ref">S.i.207</span>. This evergreen creeper has soft porous wood, velvety rusty-colored shoots, paired tendrils and a creamy-white flower. The leaves, which are sewn together to make plates, are downy beneath and have two rounded lobes on the end giving them the shape of a camel’s footprint and hence the plant’s English name. The big woody pods burst open in the summer heat. The seeds can be eaten and the strong rough fiber in the bark is used to make ropes. Despite its usefulness, the camel’s foot creeper causes great damage to forest trees, twining around them, stunting their growth and sometimes killing them <span class="ref">Ja.v.452</span>. It is a fast-growing plant <span class="ref">Dhp.334</span> and its leaves large enough to be used as plates <span class="ref">Ja.v.389</span>. A man described his lover as “clinging to me like a <em>māluvā</em> creeper” <span class="ref">Ja.v.215</span>. The Buddha said that passions spread the way the <em>māluvā</em> 
creeper spreads through the forest <span class="ref">Sn.272</span>.</p>
<p>On another occasion he used this plant in a parable in which he warned that although sense pleasures may give immediate satisfaction, they can cause problems later. “Imagine that in the last month of the summer the pod of a <em>māluvā</em> creeper bursts and a seed drop at the foot of a sal tree... Being fertile and not being swallowed by a peacock, eaten by an animal, destroyed by a forest fire, carried away by a forester or destroyed by termites, it was eventually watered by the rains, sprouts and put forth a soft downy shoot which wound around the sal tree. The spirit living in the sal tree thought ‘The touch of this <em>māluvā</em> creeper is pleasant.’ But in time the creeper grew around the tree, made a canopy over it and draped a curtain all around it and broke its branches. And then the spirit of the sal tree thought ‘This is the coming danger.

Blackbuck are found in open grassland and light scrub and are now extinct in northern India. A beautiful woman was described as being “doe-eyed” <span class="ref">Ja.v.215</span> and the Buddha said that those monks who followed his instructions lived happily, unruffled and “with a mind like a blackbuck” <span class="ref">M.i.450</span>. <strong>Forest-living monks were often said to be like</strong> <strong>miga in that they were alert, harmless, wandered freely and retreated deeper into the forest when they encountered people <span class="ref">Ja.i.390</span> <span class="ref">Mil.212</span> <span class="ref">Sn.39</span>.</strong> The Buddha 
proclaimed the Dhamma for the first time in a blackbuck reserve called Migadāya near Vārānasi and the pedestals of ancient Indian Buddha images depicting this event often include two blackbuck flanking a Dhamma wheel.

<dd><p>Barley, Hindi <em>jau</em>, <em>Hordeum vulgare</em> <span class="ref">A.i.8</span> <span class="ref">S.v.10</span>, an annual erect tufted grass resembling wheat and producing an edible grain. Cattle had to be prevented from wandering into barley fields and eating the crop <span class="ref">S.iv.195</span>. After harvesting, it was tied into sheaves and beaten with flails <span class="ref">S.iv.201</span>. Barley was used as food, fodder and in brewing. A popular preparation was called <em>yāvaka</em> <span class="ref">Ja.vi.373</span> which Pāṇinī says was made by pounding barley in a mortar to remove the chaff and boiling it in either water or milk and then adding sugar. Barley meal, called <em>sattu</em>, was prepared as a gruel or made into a dough and baked <span class="ref">Ja.iii.343</span> <span class="ref">Vin.iv.78</span>. The Buddha’s first meal after his enlightenment was barley gruel and honey balls offered to him by the merchants Tapassu and Bhalluka <span class="ref">Vin.i.3</span>. Monks put barley meal in their needle cases to prevent the needles from rubbing together and becoming blunt <span class="ref">Vin.ii.116</span>. In ancient India the 
width of a barley corn was used as a unit of measurement. The Buddha mentioned that the awn (<em><a href="#suka">suka</a></em>) of a barley corn if positioned wrongly, could pierce the hand or foot and draw blood <span class="ref">A.i.8</span>. A proverb said that a person could get irritated the way a barley awn irritates the eye <span class="ref">Ja.vi.294</span></p>
<p>
The Buddha mentioned another type of barley without naming it. He said: “When a barley field is ready, the contamination, the chaff, the rubbish of barley may appear, its root, stalk and leaf the same as true barley but without the same head. Only when the head forms do the farmers know ‘This is the contamination, the chaff, the rubbish of the true barley’ and knowing this they pull it out by the roots and throw it outside the barley field. And why? Because they think ‘Let it not contaminate the true barley’ ”<span class="ref">A.iv.169</span>. This is probably referring to Wild Barley, <em>Hordeum spontaneum</em>, the ancestor of <em>H. vulgae</em>, which looks very similar to it except that it has a shorter stem, narrower leaves and a smaller head. Wild barley competes with cultivated barley, lowers yields and is considered a weed.</p></dd></dl>

Trees are perennial erect plants usually with a single woody stem from which branches bearing leaves extend. The Jātaka says: “It is called a tree because it has branches. Without branches it’s just a stake”<span class="ref">Ja.iv.483</span>. The Tipiṭaka mentions many types of trees, and trees in general. Some of the structural components and other parts of trees referred to include the roots (<em>mūla</em>), the trunk (<em>daṇḍa</em> or <em>khandha</em>), the periderm or outer bark (<em>papaṭikā</em>), the phloem or inner bark (<em>taca</em>), the sapwood (<em>pheggu</em>), the heartwood (<em><a href="#s%C4%81ra">sāra</a></em>), branches (<em>sākhā</em>), twigs (<em>pasākhā</em>), leaves (<em>paṇṇa</em> or <em><a href="#pa%E1%B9%AD%E1%B9%ADa">paṭṭa</a></em>) and crown (<em>agga</em>, <span class="ref">M.i.193-196</span>).</p>
<p>Roots, those parts of trees and other plants that anchor them and absorb and transport water and nutrients, are discussed in detail in the Tipiṭaka. Some of the different root systems mentioned include large woody roots (<em>mūla</em>), tap roots and lateral roots (<em>mūlāni ahogamāniyāni</em> <em>tiriyaṅgamāni</em>), feeder roots (<em>nāḷi</em>), spreading roots (<em>mūlasantānaka</em>), hair roots (<em>mattāni</em>, <span class="ref">S.ii.87-8</span> <span class="ref">S.iii.155</span>, and in the case of some other plants, tubers (<em><a href="#%C4%81luka">āluka</a></em> or <em>āluva</em>, <span class="ref">Ja.iv.46</span>) and bulbous roots (<em><a href="#kanda">kanda</a></em>, <span class="ref">D.i.101</span>). The aerial roots of banyan trees were called “trunk-sprung” (<em>khandhaja</em>, <span class="ref">Sn.272</span>). It was understood that roots absorb moisture and nutrition from the soil and that the sap (<em><a href="#oj%C4%81">ojā</a></em>) moves upwards through the trunk into the branches and leaves. The <em>Visuddhimagga</em> says: “When a great tree is growing on the earth, nourished by the essence of humus and, with that as condition, its roots and trunk, branches and shoots, 
foliage, flowers and fruit grow so it fills the sky and continues the tree’s species until the end of the aeon, one cannot say that the essence of humus is only found in the roots but not in the trunk or in the fruit but not in the roots, and so on. And why? Because it spreads throughout the whole tree from the roots upwards” <span class="ref">Vism.688</span>. The Buddha said: “Just as a tree that has been cut down can grow again if its root is undamaged and complete, in the same way this suffering returns again and again if the tendency to craving is not removed” <span class="ref">Dhp.338</span>. However, it was observed that some plants, palm trees in particular, could not grow again if they were “cut off at the root” <span class="ref">A.i.137</span>.</p>
<p>There were still large forested tracts in northern India during the Buddha’s time. The Mahāvana or Great Forest, extended almost unbroken from the outskirts of Vesālī to the lower Himalayas. Once, the Buddha stayed in a forest near the village of Pārileyya where an elephant looked after him <span class="ref">Ud.42</span>. Other forests visited by the Buddha were the Dark Wood near Sāvatthi <span class="ref">S.i.130</span>, the Forest of Offering at Kusinārā <span class="ref">A.v.78</span> the Gosiṅga Forest at Vesālī where many sal trees grew <span class="ref">A.v.134</span> and the Cool Forest to the west of Rājagaha near the city’s charnel ground <span class="ref">A.iii.373</span>. Very large and majestic trees were sometimes called <em>vanaspati</em>, “forest lords” <span class="ref">S.iv.302</span> <span class="ref">Vin.iii.47</span>.</p>
<p>The Buddha encouraged monks and nuns to seek solitary lodgings in the forest <span class="ref">A.ii.250</span>, “at the roots of trees, mountain slopes, a glen, a hill cave, a cemetery or a woodland grove” <span class="ref">M.iii.3</span>. He said: “The one who wears rag-robes, who is lean, with protruding veins and who meditates alone in the forest - him I call a true Brahmin” <span class="ref">Dhp.395</span>. Some monks tried living in hollow trees and in the fork of trees <span class="ref">Vin.i.152</span>. A forest-dwelling monk was advised not to settle down at the foot of a tree on a border, one used as a shrine, one from which resin or fruit was collected, one in which flying foxes roost, a hollow tree or one growing in a monastery <span class="ref">Vism.74</span>.</p>
<p>However, forests could also be frightening places; they were the abode of dangerous animals and bandits and travelers could get lost in them <span class="ref">A.i.153</span> <span class="ref">Ja.i.320</span> <span class="ref">S.i.181</span> <span class="ref">S.iii.108</span>. The Buddha commented that when he lived in the forest before his enlightenment sometimes at night “an animal would prowl around, a peacock would snap a twig or the wind would rustle the leaves” and he would be filled with terror <span class="ref">M.i.210</span>. Those entering the forest had to be careful of what fruit they ate as some were poisonous <span class="ref">Ja.iii.200</span>. Some forested areas were thorny, unpleasant and difficult to walk through without getting cut or scratched <span class="ref">S.iv.189</span>.</p>
<p>Trees, whether wild or cultivated, provided people with many useful products, the main ones being fuel for fire and material for building. People gathered fire wood in forests <span class="ref">S.i.180</span> and the Jātaka says: “Forests are made of (potential) fire wood” <span class="ref">Ja.i.289</span>. Once the Buddha met King Pasenadi’s minister of works while he was supervising the cutting of timber in a sal forest <span class="ref">S.i.179</span>. The Bhaddasāla Jātaka makes the interesting comment that all the royal palaces in India were supported by numerous columns, some of which must have been wooden. It seems that the king of Benares wanted to construct a magnificent palace supported by a single column and commanded his officers to find a tree trunk big enough for the purpose. They went to the forest and located enough such trees but the state of the roads, they reported to the king, would not allow for the transportation of such a huge log <span class="ref">Ja.iv.153</span>.</p>
<p>Fences and kraals were made out of the branches of thorn trees <span class="ref">Vin.ii.154</span>. The leaves of certain trees were used to make various household articles like baskets, fans and plates and were used as wrappers for food <span class="ref">S.v.438</span> <span class="ref">Ja.vi.510</span>. Parasols could be made out of leaves <span class="ref">Ja.iii.79</span>. The seed pods (<em>sipātikā</em>) of some trees contained down (<em><a href="#t%C5%ABla">tūla</a></em>) which could be used to stuff pillows and pad furniture and saddles.</p>
<p>Another product of trees that a use was found for was the bark (<em>taca</em>, <em>vāka</em> or <em><a href="#vakkala">vakkala</a></em>, <span class="ref">A.i.152</span> <span class="ref">D.i.167</span> <span class="ref">Ja.ii.13</span> <span class="ref">M.i.198</span>). Household articles like fans and ropes are occasionally mentioned as being made out of bark <span class="ref">Ja.iii.204</span> <span class="ref">Vin.ii.130</span>. Ascetics are often described as being dressed in <em><a href="#vakkala">vakkala</a></em> <span class="ref">A.i.240</span> <span class="ref">Ja.ii.274</span>. Although this is usually taken to mean a type of cloth made from bark this may not be the case. More likely it was made out of fibers from the phloem or inner bark of some type of tree or trees. <em><a href="#vakkala">Vakkala</a></em> clothing made a rustling noise as the wearer moved <span class="ref">Ja.ii.274</span>. The commentary to the Nidānakathā mentions some of the benefits of this unusual type of clothing. It is cheap, it can be made by oneself, it is hard to get dirty and easy to wash, it is easy to mend, it is not difficult to get a new one when the old one is worn out, it is suitable for the ascetic life, thieves do not bother to steal it, it does not beautify the wearer, it is light 
to wear, it is conducive to contentment, it can be obtained by righteous means and if it is lost it causes no regret <span class="ref">Ja.i.9</span>. <em><a href="#vakkala">Vakkala</a></em> might have also refered to ordinary cotton or hemp cloth colored with a dye made from the bark of the <em><a href="#tir%C4%AB%E1%B9%ADa">tirīṭa</a></em> tree <span class="ref">D.i.66</span> <span class="ref">M.i.343</span>. There are occasional references to ascetics wearing wood fibers (<em>darucīraka</em>), which might be an alternitave name for <em><a href="#vakkala">vakkala</a></em> <span class="ref">Ud.39</span>, or wearing <em><a href="#phalaka">phalaka</a></em>, which may have been wooden slats or even wood shavings <span class="ref">Vin.i.360</span>. These and similar unusual clothing are described as the “characteristic of ascetics of other sects” and were not allowed to be worn by Buddhist monks <span class="ref">Vin.i.306</span>.</p>
<p>The Buddha encouraged the planting of fruit trees along roads to offer both shade and food for travelers <span class="ref">S.i.33</span>. We read of a man tapping tree trunks with his axe to find hollow ones to use as water pipes <span class="ref">A.iv.170</span> and another doing so to find hollows where bees might be nesting <span class="ref">Ja.iii.200</span>. Sometimes as an act of merit, people would repair roads by filling in pot holes, removing large stones and cutting down the trees that might strike the axles of passing chariots and carts <span class="ref">Ja.i.199</span>. Certain trees were cultivated for their fruit, flowers, foliage and timber. To grow successfully, a sapling had to have its roots cleared of weeds from time to time, be fertilized with humus (<em>paṃsu</em>) and be regularly watered <span class="ref">S.ii.89</span>.
People believed that spirits lived in medical herbs and trees (<em>ārāmadevatā</em>, <em>rukkhadevatā</em>, <em>vanadevatā</em>, <span class="ref">A.iii.369</span> <span class="ref">M.i.307</span> <span class="ref">S.iv.302</span>), particularly very old, gnarled or beautiful ones. These spirits lived in the hollow of trees or in their crowns <span class="ref">Ja.i.405</span> <span class="ref">Ja.i.423</span>. Before cutting a tree, a woodsman would inform the tree spirit of his intentions and make offerings to it <span class="ref">Ja.i.442</span> <span class="ref">Ja.iv.114</span>. Other trees were worshipped and given offerings because the spirits were believed to grant wishes. Milk and water were poured on the roots, garlands were hung in the branches, lamps of scented oil were burned around them and cloth was tied around their trunks <span class="ref">Ja.ii.104</span>. There is the occasional mention of animal and even human sacrifices being made to trees. The victim’s blood was poured around the foot of the tree and the entrails were draped over the branches <span class="ref">Ja.i.260</span> <span class="ref">Ja.iii.160</span>. It was believed that trees would give their bounty on condition that they were treated with a degree of respect and the 
Buddha told a story that illustrates this point. Long ago, the mythical King Koravya had an amazing banyan tree in his realm which bore fruit of exceptional sweetness. Everyone in the realm enjoyed the fruit freely and so there was no reason to guard the tree. But one day a man ate his fill of the fruit then broke a branch and went away. This act of ingratitude so angered the tree spirit that it caused the tree to bear no more fruit <span class="ref">A.iii.369-70</span>.</p>
<p>As with other popular beliefs and superstitions the Buddha did not endorse tree worship. He said: “Gripped by fear people go to sacred mountains, groves, parks and trees. But these are not a safe refuge, not the best refuge. By going there one is not freed from all suffering” <span class="ref"><span class="ref">Dhp.188</span>-9</span>. However, the Buddha did respect the beliefs of others and when a certain monk cut down a tree worshipped by local people to make way for a monastery he severly rebuked him for doing so <span class="ref">Vin.iii.156</span>.</p>
<p>
Some of the most beautiful passages in Buddhist literature relate to trees. The Buddha said of a kindly hospitable person that he was “like a great banyan tree growing on the side of roads that welcomes weary travelers with its cool shade and soothes their tiredness” <span class="ref">Ja.vi.526</span>. The general Buddhist attitude of respect for trees is expressed in these words from the Petavatthu: “Of the tree in whose shade one sits or lies, not a branch of it should he break, for if he did he would be a betrayer of a friend, an evil doer...Of the tree in whose shade one sits or lies, not a leaf should he injure, for if he did he would be a betrayer of a friend, an evil doer” <span class="ref">Pv.21.3</span> <span class="ref">Pv.21.5</span>. The <em>Milindapañha</em> says that the diligent disciple should try to be like a tree. “As a tree makes no distinction in the shade it gives, like this, the meditator should make no distinction between any beings, but develop love equally to thieves, murderers, enemies and to himself” <span class="ref">Mil.410</span>. The 
<em>Buddhacarita</em> compares spiritual practice to a tree “the fibers of which are patience, the flowers virtue, the boughs awareness and wisdom, which is rooted in resolution and which bears the fruit of Dhamma”<span class="ref">Bc.13.65</span>. The <em>Mahāvastu</em> says: “The meritorious person grows like a banyan tree, while the person of little merit becomes stunted like a tree planted in the roadway” <span class="ref">Mv.ii.423</span>. In his <em>Bodhicariyāvatāra</em>, the poet Śāntideva wrote of his longing for the peace of the forest life in these words: “The trees do not speak harsh words nor do they try to please by artifice. When shall I have the opportunity to dwell with those happy to live with the trees?”<span class="ref">Bcv.viii.26</span>.</p></dd></dl>

The Pāḷi name means “chattering bird” probably because of the squeaks, whistles and nattering sounds quails exchange when in flocks. Six species of quails are found in northern India, all of them very similar and the most common being the Common Quail, <em>Coturnix coturnix</em>. About the same size as a dove, this squat plump little bird has light brown plumage covered with pale yellow-brown spear-shaped streaks and mottles, a white band around the front of its neck and above its eyes. Like other quails, it is often seen in pairs or large flocks in grasslands and cultivated fields. Quails could be seen running amongst the clods after the fields had been ploughed <span class="ref">Ja.ii.59</span> <span class="ref">S.v.146</span>. They were hunted with nets <span class="ref">Ja.i.208</span> and taken home to be fattened up before being eaten <span class="ref">Ja.i.434</span>. Male quails are very pugnacious and setting them to fight each other was a popular entertainment <span class="ref">D.i.6</span>. The Buddha said that too 
much or too little exertion could be detrimental to concentration, just as holding a quail too tightly would kill it or holding it too loosely would allow it to fly through one’s fingers <span class="ref">M.iii.159</span>. Once, when the arrogant young brahmin Ambaṭṭha was visiting the Sākyans, he got the distinct impression that they were whispering about and laughing at him. Later he complained of this to the Buddha who defended his kinsmen by saying: “But Ambaṭṭha, even the quail, that little bird, can talk as she likes in her own nest” <span class="ref">D.i.91</span>. According to the Jātakas, the Bodhisattva was once reborn as an elephant and became leader of a large herd. A quail made her nest in the elephant’s feeding ground and the Bodhisattva stood over it to prevent it being trampled by the other elephants <span class="ref">Ja.iii.174</span>. Again according to the Jātaka, the Bodhisattva was once reborn as a quail <span class="ref">Ja.ii.59</span>.</p></dd></dl>

This large primate has a silver-gray body with a white belly and a black face. With its long limbs and tail the langur moves through the trees or along the ground with a series of graceful bounds. There is intense competition to become the dominant male and one that does will immediately try to kill all the young so that the females will come into estrous and he can mate with them. This behavior seems to have been noticed by the ancient Indians and is probably the basis of the Tayodhamma Jātaka <span class="ref">Ja.i.280-2</span>. In this story the dominant male of a troop of langurs castrates with his teeth all the infant males out of fear that they may grow up and replace him.

Ranging in height from small to very tall and growing in dense clumps, bamboos have hollow segmented tube-like stems and branches from which grow long spear-shaped leaves. Over 30 varieties grow in northern India. Bamboo is an economically important plant, its strong but light and flexible wood being used for a wide variety of purposes. Washing was hung on bamboo poles and needle cases were made out of bamboo tubes. It was also plated and woven into baskets <span class="ref">Vin.iv.5</span> and grown in lines to form hedges <span class="ref">Vin.ii.154</span>.

To this day dense thickets of the Thorny Bamboo, <em>Bambusa arundinacea</em>, grow around Rajgir, modern Rājagaha, and may be the type that was familiar to the Buddha. The ancient Buddhists believed that having the flexibility of bamboo would be a virtue. The Jātaka commented that to live successfully in the royal court it is wise to “bend like bamboo”<span class="ref">Ja.vi.295</span>. Nāgasena said: “Bamboo does not bend any which way, but the way the wind blows. Likewise the monk, having followed the nine parts of the Buddha’s, the Lord’s teachings and being established in that which is good and blameless, should go the way of true 
asceticism” <span class="ref">Mil.ii.372</span>.

This large majestic cat has an orange coat patterned with black stripes, a banded tail and black ears. Tigers live in thick jungle and thorny shrub where they hunt mainly deer. The tiger is not mentioned in the Vedas and only occasionally in the four Nikāyas. Perhaps they became common in northern India only as lions died out. In one place, the tiger is described as being striped and is called “the king of the beasts” a term usually used only for the lion <span class="ref">Ja.iv.345</span>. We read of a man-eating tiger attacking travelers on the high road to Vārānasi <span class="ref">Ja.i.357</span>. The Buddha sometimes stayed with a clan of people known as Tiger’s Track, Vyagghapajjā <span class="ref">A.ii.194</span>. Royal chariots were upholstered with leopard or tiger skins <span class="ref">Ja.vi.503</span>, a fact also mentioned by Pāṇinī.

Conch shells were considered one of the many precious things found in the ocean along with pearls, gems, beryl, crystal, coral, gold and silver, ruby and emerald <span class="ref">Ud.54</span>. During coronation ceremonies water from three conch shells was sprinkled on the monarch’s head <span class="ref">Ja.ii.409</span> <span class="ref">Ja.iv.493</span>.They were blown as trumpets and sometimes played together with a small drum <span class="ref">Ja.iv.21</span>.

They were also sometimes known as <em>maṇḍūkabhakkha</em> ‘frog eater’<span class="ref">Ja.iii.16</span>. It is uncertain whether all these words are synonyms or refer to different species of snakes. Snakes are legless, long-bodied reptiles of the suborder Serpentes. In Jain literature snakes are classified as either with or without a hood, while the Buddha classified them as either venomous and docile, non-venomous and aggressive, venomous and aggressive or non-venomous and docile <span class="ref">A.ii.110</span>. Snakes shed their skins <span class="ref">Sn.1</span>, have forked tongues, long backs, crawl on their bellies <span class="ref">Sn.604</span> and are commonly found living in anthills <span class="ref">S.iv.197</span>. The 
reverence people had for snakes was often mixed with fear and disgust <span class="ref">Vin.i.218</span>. The Tipiṭaka contains several accounts of people being bitten by snakes and dying <span class="ref">A.ii.70</span>. People wore charms to protect themselves from and to cure snake bites <span class="ref">Ja.vi.178</span>. A doctor could give medicine against a snake bite or force the snake to suck the poison out of the wound <span class="ref">Ja.i.310</span>. One cure for a snake bite was a concoction of cow dung and urine, ash or clay <span class="ref">Vin.i.205</span>.</p>
<p>The Buddha said that one should be careful even of young snakes. “One should not dismiss the snake one might see in village or forest just because it is young. But that snake, fierce, sliding along, with serpentine movements, may attack and bite the foolish man or woman. Therefore, protect your life and avoid that snake” <span class="ref">S.i.69</span>. Not everyone tried to avoid snakes. We read of children tormenting a snake, probably a small one, with a stick <span class="ref">Ud.11</span>. The Buddha described some species of snakes as being dirty and odorous, terrifying, dangerous and given to betraying their friends <span class="ref">A.iii.260</span>. To catch snakes charmers would pin their heads down with a forked stick and then grasp them by the neck <span class="ref">M.i.134</span>. The Snake River, Sappinī, at Rājagaha was so named because of its winding serpentine course <span class="ref">A.ii.27</span>. It was believed that some snakes were born in the Himalayas from where they migrated down the streams and rivers to the sea and then grew into sea monsters <span class="ref">S.v.46</span>. Several types of water snakes are 
mentioned <span class="ref">Ja.ii.238</span>, in particular the <em><a href="#alagadda">alagadda</a></em> which is described as being venomous <span class="ref">M.i.133</span>.
The Tipiṭaka mentions a snake with a copper-colored or red head <span class="ref">Ja.vi.194</span> which can only be the Copper Head, <em>Elaphe radiata</em>. This large handsome snake has a copper-colored or orange head with a black stripe over it and a yellowish-brown body with three black stripes down the sides. The copper head prefers open country near jungles and undergrowth and is often seen in fields and near villages where it feeds almost exclusively on rodents.The Jātaka correctly points out that the copper head is non-venomous.

However, the word commentary on the Jātaka and numerous Sanskrit sources, say that swarms of <em>salabha</em> sometimes destroy crops <span class="ref">Ja.v.401</span> leading us to think that locusts or grasshoppers are being referred to.

They also sometimes raid crops. When threatened, the porcupine erects and then rattles its quills as a warning. The porcupine’s name is derived from <em>salla</em>, “arrow”, not because its quills resemble arrows but because of the widespread folk belief that it can shoot its quills.

The leaves of the Indian frankincense are hung up in cow stalls to drive away flies. Real frankincense, which is produced in the southern Arabian Peninsular, was imported into India.

Being thus banished, they settled at the foot of the Himalayan foothills beside a lotus pond where there was a <em>sāka</em> forest. Not wanting to degrade their 
lineage, they cohabited with their own sisters. King Okkāka asked his ministers and advisers: ‘Where are they living now?’ and when they told him he said: ‘They are strong as <em>sākas</em>, they are real Sākyans! ’ and this is how the Sākyans got their well-known name” <span class="ref">D.i.92</span>.</p></dd></dl>

The huge sal trees that grew in the lower reaches of the Himalayas are described as having leaves and foliage, bark and shoots, soft wood and heart wood <span class="ref">D.iii.152</span>.</p>
<p>The Tipiṭaka describes how a man would make a boat out of a sal trunk. First he would locate a large tree in the forest and cut it down with his ax. After shaping the exterior and hollowing out the inside, he would then further shape it with a scraper and then smooth it with a rock ball. Finally, he would fix a rudder, make a pair of oars and then slide it down to the river <span class="ref">A.ii.201</span>. The Buddha describes a man going to a sal forest near a village and cutting down the other trees and the crooked sal saplings so that the already well-established sal trees would grow bigger and straighter <span class="ref">M.i.125</span>. Sal trees were sometimes strangled by parasitic vines <span class="ref">Dhp.162</span> <span class="ref">Ja.v.452</span>.</p>
<p>The Rukkhadhamma Jātaka uses the thickness of a sal forest to illustrate the advantages of unity. King Vessavaṇa asked all the tree spirits to select for themselves a plant as their home. The Bodhisattva, who had been reborn as a tree spirit, advised his kinsmen to avoid trees that stood alone and pick those that grew close to others. Some did as he advised, making their homes in a thick sal forest, but others moved into isolated trees growing near towns and villages thinking that they would receive offerings humans made to such trees. One day a mighty storm swept over the country uprooting even the mightiest and most deeply rooted trees growing in the open. But the sal trees in the forest, supported by each other and with their branches interlaced withstood the storm <span class="ref">Ja.i.328-9</span>.</p>
<p>When the Buddha arrived in Kusinārā on his last tour and lay down between two sal trees, they burst into flower out of season and sprinkled their petals over him. When Ānanda expressed amazement that the very trees were revering him, the Buddha said: “Ānanda, these sal trees burst into flower out of season in homage to the Tathāgata and covered his body - but the monk or the nun, the lay man or the lay woman who lives practicing the Dhamma properly and perfectly fulfills the Dhamma, they honors, reveres and respects the Tathāgata with the highest homage” <span class="ref">D.ii.137-8</span>. In the light of this story and the traditional belief that the Buddha passed away during Vesākha, it is interesting to note that the sal usually blossoms in March-April and occasionally in May. The Buddha once said that his Dhamma was so convincing that if the great sal trees had consciousness and could comprehend, even they would benefit from it <span class="ref">A.ii.193</span>.</p>
<p>One moonlit night, Ānanda and Revata went to visit Sāriputta at the sal forest of Gosinga which was “delightful - with all the trees in full bloom and with a heavenly fragrance wafting through the air” <span class="ref">M.i.212</span>. Sometimes gruel was made from or flavored with sal flowers or perhaps its resin <span class="ref">A.iii.49</span>. The sal was and continues to be even today an important source of timber in India. Oil distilled from the seeds is used for lamps and the resin which exudes naturally or is sometimes tapped is used as a medicine, to make incense and also a perfume called <em>dammar</em> in Hindi. Sal butter, which is extracted from the seeds, is used as substitute for cocoa in the manufacture of chocolate. The past Buddha Vessabhū attained enlightenment under a <em>mahāsāla</em><span class="ref">D.ii.4</span> which probably refers to a particularly large individual tree.</p></dd></dl>

The hill myna has glossy-black plumage with white patches on the wings, bright yellow patches of skin, wattles below its eyes and yellow beak and legs. It lives mainly in the hills that border the northern edge of the Ganges valley and feeds on fruit. It has a loud although not unpleasant warbling creaking song and is very good at imitating human speech <span class="ref">D.iii.202</span> which even today makes it a popular cage bird. Vaṅgīsa said that the Buddha’s voice was sweet like that of the myna <span class="ref">Th.1232</span>, and Sāriputta’s voice was described similarly <span class="ref">S.i.190</span>. Teaching mynas and parrots to speak is mentioned in the <em>Kāma Sūtra</em> as a pleasant pastime.

<dd><p>Hindi <em>shisham</em> or <em>sissu</em>, <em>Dalbergia sissoo</em>. This large handsome deciduous tree has ovate leaves, their broader ends towards the base and about twice as long as broad. The flowers are small and yellowish. They are widely grown for their fine timber and along roads for shade or on common ground around villages. When in Ālāvi, the Buddha once stayed in the nearby <em>siṃsapā</em> grove where he slept on the leaf-strewn ground <span class="ref">A.i.136</span>. There was another such grove at Setavya <span class="ref">D.ii.316</span>. Once, while staying in a <em>siṃsapā</em> grove near Kosambī, the Buddha gathered up a few leaves and asked the monks: “Which are more numerous, this handful of leaves or those on the trees above?” “The leaves in your hand are few while more are the leaves on the trees” replied the monks. Then the Buddha said: “Likewise, the things I have discovered but not taught are numerous while the things I have taught are few. And why did I not teach all these things? Because they are 
useless, irrelevant to living the holy life and do not lead to turning away, dispassion, cessation, peace, higher knowledge and Nirvāṇa” <span class="ref">S.v.437</span>. Today, the <em>siṃsapā</em> is one of India’s main timber trees.</p></dd></dl>

They could be seen sitting by rivers waiting for fish <span class="ref">M.i.335</span> or prowling up and down the banks looking for prey like tortoises <span class="ref">S.iv.177</span>. They would also eat frogs and mice around the threshing floors in harvested fields <span class="ref">D.iii.26</span> and enter cities at night through the sewers to scavenge in the garbage heaps <span class="ref">Ja.iii.414</span>. Jackals were often seen in the company of lions and lived on the remains of their prey <span class="ref">D.iii.24</span>. The yelp of the jackal cannot be compared with the roar of the lion <span class="ref">A.i.187</span>, rather, it was considered pathetic and comical.

<dd><p>Asian Openbill Stork, <em>Anastomus oscitians</em>. This small stork is white or grayish with black wings and orange legs. The mandibles of the reddish-black bill are slightly arched, creating a gap between them and thus the Pāḷi name meaning “loose mouth”. The openbill stork is commonly found throughout India. Its feathers were used to make flights for arrows <span class="ref">M.i.429</span>.</p></dd></dl>

<dd><p>White Mustard, <em>Brassica campestris</em> <span class="ref">Ja.iii.225</span> <span class="ref">Ja.vi.537</span>, an erect stout herb with a blue-green flower and pods and that yields numerous small round reddish-brown seeds from which an oil is extracted. A white mustard seed gets a mention in one of the most famous incident in the Buddha’s life. Once a young woman named Kisāgotamī lost her child and mad with grief she ran through the town pleading with people to give her medicine for her child. Eventually she came to the Buddha who gently told her to get a white mustard seed from a house in which no one had ever died. Thinking that this seed would miraculously revive her child she went from house to house asking for one. Everyone was willing to give her one of the tiny seeds but when she asked if anyone had ever died in the house she was always told that someone had. Slowly it dawned on Kisāgotamī that death is an inevitable part of life and her grief gave way to acceptance and understanding <span class="ref">Dhp-a.273</span>.</p>
<p>In ancient India white mustard was widely used as an ingredient in medicines for children’s diseases. It was also a common component in rituals meant to protect children from malevolent influences. This suggests that the storyteller’s choice of a white mustard seed in the Kisāgotamī story was not random or incidental but was used to make the reader initially think that the Buddha was going to cure the child by conventional means.</p></dd></dl>

The Freshwater Mussel, <em>Lamellidens marginalis</em> <span class="ref">A.iii.393</span> <span class="ref">D.i.84</span> <span class="ref">M.ii.22</span>, is a bivalve commonly found in rivers, ponds and paddy fields throughout northern India. Its rounded elongated shells are dark-brown on the outside and pearly-white on the inside. These shells were used for cleaning, either as scrapers for the skin or ground into an abrasive powder <span class="ref">A.i.208</span> <span class="ref">Vin.i.107</span>. The Buddha said that if a man were to look into a pool of clear, still unstirred water he would be able to see mussel shells, pebbles and gravel <span class="ref">A.i.9</span>.
The shell of the cowrie, a marine mollusk of the family Cypraeidea, is also sometimes mentioned. Cowrie shells are humped with flattened bottoms. The opening of the shell has inrolled lips with tooth-like ridges on both sides. The underside is usually white, cream or yellow and the top is glossy and usually speckled.

The Asiatic lion is a large stately tawny-colored cat with a long tail with a tuft at the end. It differs slightly from its African cousin, being smaller and having a fringe of hair down its abdomen and in the males a less luxuriant mane. The lion’s preferred habitat is dry jungle and open grassland where they hunt deer and sometimes domestic cattle.</p>
<p>The Buddha said that of all animals the lion is the best in respect to strength, speed and courage <span class="ref">S.v.227</span>. They were said to be “five-pawed”(<em>pañcahattha</em>), the mouth being the fifth “paw” <span class="ref">Ja.v.425</span>. Being a noble creature, they always lie on their right sides, with one paw on the other and with their tails between their thighs <span class="ref">A.ii.245</span>. The male lion emerges from its lair in the evening, stretches, looks around, roars three times and then goes in search of prey <span class="ref">A.ii.32</span>.When other animals hear the lion’s roar they are frightened. “Those who live in burrows descend into them, aquatic animals take to the water, forest dwellers make for the forest and birds take to the air” <span class="ref">A.ii.33</span>. When the lion strikes at its prey, whether it be an elephant, buffalo, ox, leopard, hare or cat, it does so with great skill <span class="ref">A.iii.121</span>.</p>
<p>In one place we read of monks finding and eating the remains of a lion’s prey <span class="ref">Vin.iii.57</span> and of monks being attacked and killed by lions. Lions are often accompanied by jackals. A preparation called lion oil was considered very valuable, but it is uncertain whether it was given this name because of its supposed potency or because it was actually made from lion tallow <span class="ref">Ja.i.98</span> <span class="ref">Ja.v.149</span>. There was a market for lion’s hides, claws, teeth and fat <span class="ref">Ja.i.388</span>.
Sīha (Sanskrit Siṃgha) has long been a popular name in India. One of the Buddha’s disciples, a general, was named Sīha <span class="ref">A.iii.38</span> as were several monks <span class="ref">D.i.151</span> <span class="ref">Th.83</span>. The Buddha himself said: “Lion, monks, is a name for the Tathāgata, the Arahat, the Fully Enlightened one” <span class="ref">A.iii.121</span>. When he lay down to rest or to sleep, the Buddha always did so in the “lion posture”, i.e. on his right side, with one foot on the other, mindful and fully aware <span class="ref">S.i.27</span> <span class="ref">S.i.106</span>. His bold and confident claim to be enlightened was called his “lion’s roar” <span class="ref">A.ii.10</span>. Two of the 32 special characteristics of the Mahāpurisa are that the front of his body is like that of the lion and his jaw like a lion’s <span class="ref">D.ii.18</span>. Lions often feature in the Jātakas where they are depicted as either noble or fearsome creatures, but also sometimes as foolish or mean-spirited.</p>
<p>Even in the middle of the 19<sup>th</sup> century Asiatic lions were still found in the less populated parts of the Middle East and northern India but today the last 300 or so are restricted to the Gir Forest in Gujarat.

The Pāḷi names <em><a href="#j%C4%81tisuman%C4%81">jātisumanā</a></em> <span class="ref">Ja.v.420</span>, <em><a href="#mallik%C4%81">mallikā</a></em> <span class="ref">A.i.226</span> <span class="ref">Dhp.54</span>, <em>sumanā</em> <span class="ref">Ja.v.402</span> <span class="ref">Ja.vi.440</span> <span class="ref">Ja.vi.537</span> <span class="ref">Th.96</span>, <em><a href="#vassik%C4%81">vassikā</a></em>, <em>vassikī</em> and <em><a href="#y%C5%ABthik%C4%81">yūthikā</a></em> are usually translated as jasmine. There at least a dozen plants of the genus Jasminum that grow in northern India, the most common being <em>Jasminum sambac</em>, <em>J. pubescens</em>, <em>J. scandens</em>, <em>J. arborescens</em>, <em>J. strictum</em>, <em>J. caudatum</em> and <em>J. flexile</em>. All these plants are low shrubs with woody stems that have a tendency to climb and have small simple or pinnate leaves. They all produce small, usually white but sometimes pink or yellow flowers. All grow wild although several are 
also cultivated. In the case of <em>J. sambac</em>, an essential oil is extracted from the flower and is used in incense and perfume. The <em><a href="#mallik%C4%81">mallikā</a></em> was considered the most fragrant of all flowers <span class="ref">S.iii.157</span>. There is a reference to cloth with a <em>sumanā</em> flower pattern printed or embroidered on it <span class="ref">Ja.i.62</span> and the Buddha asked his disciples to imitate the <em><a href="#vassik%C4%81">vassikā</a></em>. “Just as the jasmine sheds its withered flowers, so you, oh monks, should shed desire and hatred”<span class="ref">Dhp.377</span>.</p>

The Ganges dolphin is a large cetacean varying in color from slate-blue to muddy brown and with a long thin beak bearing a row of sharp interlocking teeth. The mouth curves upward at the end making it look as if the animal is smiling. This dolphin is found in the Ganges and Brahmaputra and their tributaries.

<dd><p>Domestic Pig, also called <em><a href="#var%C4%81ha">varāha</a></em>, Hindi <em>sukar</em>, <em>Sus scrofa</em>. Whether wild or domesticated, pigs are a stout, cloven-hoofed mammals of the order Suidae. The Indian pig is usually small, dark-gray and covered with bristles.

They were fed dried cow dung <span class="ref">D.ii.347</span> <span class="ref">M.iii.168</span>.
In his last meal before he passed away the Buddha ate a dish called <em>sūkaramaddava</em>, “pig’s delight”, but it is not known whether this contained pork <span class="ref">D.ii.127</span>. Whatever it was, <em>sūkaramaddava</em> served with <em><a href="#badara">badara</a></em> fruit was considered a sumptuous dish <span class="ref">A.iii.48</span>.

<dd><p>Domestic Dog, also called <em><a href="#bhobhukka">bhobhukka</a></em> “bow wow-maker”, <em><a href="#katthu">katthu</a></em>, <em><a href="#kukkura">kukkura</a></em>, <em><a href="#su%E1%B9%87a">suṇa</a></em>, <em><a href="#sup%C4%81%E1%B9%87a">supāṇa</a></em> and <em><a href="#suv%C4%81%E1%B9%87a">suvāṇa</a></em>, <em>Canis familiaris</em>. The great diversity in dog breeds is almost entirely due to artificial and selective breeding. With a minimum of human interference dogs are muscular animals with a broad chests, relatively long legs and strong blunt claws. In ancient India dogs were sometimes kept for hunting <span class="ref">Ja.v.289</span>, but more commonly to warn of the presence of strangers and to eat household scraps. Generally considered dirty, loathsome creatures, they were never seen as pets but were left to wander through the streets scavenging at the rubbish heaps and eating faeces and the bodies dumped in charnel grounds <span class="ref">A.iii.323</span> <span class="ref">M.iii.169</span>. Dogs are mentioned together with chickens, pigs and jackals as animals that eat dung <span class="ref">M.iii.168</span>. Unwanted babies were sometimes left out for the jackals and dogs to eat <span class="ref">Thi.303</span>. The Buddha said 
that one of the several unpleasant features of Madhura was the many fierce dogs in the streets <span class="ref">A.iii.256</span>. Brahmans would cover the food they were eating with a leaf if a dog stood near to prevent it being rendered impure by the animal’s presence.</p>
<p>We read that when a group of Licchavī youths roaming around in the forest with their weapons and hunting dogs saw the Buddha, they put down their bows and called their dogs to heel <span class="ref">A.iii.75</span>. One of the austerities practiced by some ascetics was to behave like a dog - going naked, licking their hands after eating and curling up on the ground to sleep <span class="ref">D.iii.6</span> <span class="ref">M.i.387</span>. Some ascetics would refuse to accept alms if a dog was standing nearby or flies were swarming, probably so as not to deprive them of food <span class="ref">A.i.294</span>. In one of his most severe criticisms of brahmins, the Buddha compared them unfavorably with dogs <span class="ref">A.iii.220</span>. Outcastes used to eat dogs <span class="ref">Thi.509</span>.
The various Pāḷi names for the domestic dog were probably also used for the Asiatic Wild Dog, Hindi <em>dhol</em>, <em>Cuon alpinus</em>, a reddish brown forest-living canine with shorter legs and a more bushy tail than the domestic dog. Wild dogs hunt in packs and communicate with each other by a whistling sound. The Asiatic wild dog is now extinct in northern India and increasingly rare in other parts of the sub-continent.

The leaves, flowers and fruit can all be eaten, the root, which smells and tastes like horse radish, is also eaten and an oil extracted from the seeds is used in perfumes.

<dl><dt><dfn>Soma</dfn></dt>
<dd><p>The Vedas mention a plant called <em>soma</em> from which juice was extracted, mixed with ghee and flour, left to ferment and then drunk during religious ceremonies to produce an intoxicating effect.

<p>There has been a great deal of discussion about the identity of the soma plant but a very plausible candidate is Syrian Rue, <em>Peganum harmala</em>. This perennial woody herb has bright-green leaves about 5 cm long and finely divided into long narrow segments, and an attractive white flower with five oblong-elliptic petals. The leathery seed capsules have three compartments, each containing about 50 dark-brown angular seeds. The seeds and roots have medicinal and hallucinogenic properties and also yield a red dye. Syrian rue is found in the western and central part of the Ganges valley and grows best in semi-barren areas.</p>
<p>According to the Jātaka, in two of his former lives the Bodhisattva became so fond of pressing and drinking <em>soma</em> and of offering it to the gods that he came to be known as Sutasoma <span class="ref">Ja.v.177</span> <span class="ref">Ja.v.457</span>.</p></dd></dl>

<dl><dt><dfn>Haṃsa</dfn></dt>
<dd><p>A term for water birds in general and for the Bar-headed Goose in particular, sometimes also <em><a href="#r%C4%81jaha%E1%B9%83sa">rājahaṃsa</a></em>, Hindi <em>hans</em> or <em>raj hans</em>, <em>Anser indicus</em> <span class="ref">Ja.v.356</span>. About the size of the domestic goose, this beautiful bird has gray, brown and white plumage with a white head and neck marked by two distinctive black bands. The bird’s gentle musical “<em>aang aang aang</em>” call is often praised in ancient Indian literature. The famous ornithologist Salim Ali describes it as “one of the most unforgettable and exhilarating sounds” to be heard in nature. Vaṅgīsa addressed the Buddha saying: “Quickly send forth your melodious voice, oh Beautiful One. Like geese stretching out their necks, honk gently with your soft well-modulated voice” <span class="ref">Sn.350</span>. Bar-headed geese are often seen during the winter feeding in swamps and fields, and then in mid-March they fly off to nest in Tibet. To the Buddha this migratory behavior was suggestive of detachment. “Mindful people 
exert themselves. They are not attached to any home. Like geese that quit their lakes, they leave one abode after another behind” <span class="ref">Dhp.91</span>. “Geese fly the path to the sun, sages fly by their psychic powers. Having defeated Māra and his army the wise are led away from the world” <span class="ref">Dhp.175</span>. Piṅgiya used the geese’s arrival back in northern India in October as a metaphor for the coming of something wonderful. “Just as a bird might leave a small wood to dwell in a forest full of fruit, so do I, having left narrow-minded teachers, come to He of Wide Vision, like a goose arriving at a great lake” <span class="ref">Sn.1134</span>.
One of the most beautiful legends in the whole of the Buddhist tradition comes from the Sanskrit <em>Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra</em> and concerns a bar-headed goose. Once, while walking through the palace garden, Prince Siddhattha saw a goose fall from the sky with an arrow lodged in its wing. He gently nestled the bird in his lap, extracted the arrow and anointed the wound with oil and honey. Soon afterwards, Devadatta sent a message to the palace saying that he had shot the bird and demanding that it be returned to him. Siddhattha replied to the message by saying “If the goose was dead I would return it forthwith. But as it is still alive you have no right to it.” Devadatta sent a second message arguing that it was his skill that had downed the goose and as such it belonged to him. Again Siddhattha refused to give his cousin the bird and asked that an assembly of wise men be called to settle the dispute. This was done and after discussing the matter for some time the most senior of the wise men gave his opinion, 
saying “The living belongs to he who cherishes and preserves life, not to he who tries to destroy life”. The assembly agreed with this and Prince Siddhattha was allowed to keep the goose.</p>
<p>According to the Jātaka, the Bodhisattva was sometimes reborn as a bar-headed goose <span class="ref">Ja.iii.208</span> <span class="ref">Ja.iv.246</span> <span class="ref">Ja.iv.423</span>.</p></dd></dl>

<dd><p>Asian Elephant, <em>Elephas maximus</em>, also called <em>mātaṅga</em> or <em><a href="#v%C4%81ra%E1%B9%87a">vāraṇa</a></em>, while large impressively tusked males were called <em>danta</em>, <em>gaja</em>, <em>kāhīti</em>, <em>kuñjara</em> or <em><a href="#n%C4%81ga">nāga</a></em> <span class="ref">Ja.iv.494</span> <span class="ref">Ja.vi.497</span>. A male in must was <em>pabhinna</em> <span class="ref">Dhp.324</span>. Females were called <em>uccākaṇerukā</em> <span class="ref">M.i.178</span> or <em>kareṇukā</em> <span class="ref">Ja.ii.343</span> and a female with protruding tusks was called <em>kaḷārikā</em> <span class="ref">M.i.178</span>. An elephant that had reached 60 years old was called <em>saṭṭhihāyana</em> <span class="ref">M.i.229</span> and calves were known as <em>hatthikalabha</em>, <em>kaṇeru</em> or <em>susanāga</em> <span class="ref">A.iv.435</span> <span class="ref">D.ii.254</span>. Elephants with pink spotted foreheads, a sign of age, were called <em>padumin</em> <span class="ref">D.i.75</span> <span class="ref">M.iii.93</span>. Several other types of elephants are mentioned, such as the <em>vāmanakikā</em> but it is not clear what distinguished them from others <span class="ref">Ja.v.416</span> <span class="ref">M.i.178</span>. The Pāḷi, Bengali and Hindi word <em>hatthī</em> means “one with a hand” and refers to the 
dexterous way elephants use their trunks.</p>
<p>Slightly smaller than its African cousin, the Asian elephant has grey wrinkled skin, a long trunk, a two-domed head and drooping ears. They can grow up to 3 meters at the shoulders and weigh as much as 5,000 kilograms. Asian elephants prefer thick or light jungle and eat the leaves, bark and fruit of trees, grass and aquatic vegetation. They will also raid fields and orchards.
In his famous parable of the blind men and the elephant the Buddha described the elephant’s ears as being like a winnowing basket, its tusks (<em>danta</em> or <em>hatthidanta</em>) like plough poles, the body like a granary, the legs like pillars, the tail is like a pestle and the tuft of the tail like a broom <span class="ref">Ud.68-9</span>. The frontal lobes of the elephant’s head were called “pots” (<em>kumbha</em>) and the trusks, the small tusks on females, were known as <em>kaḷārikā</em> <span class="ref">M.178</span>. Temporin, the odorous tar-like secretion that oozes from the males during must, was called <em>kaṭuka</em> <span class="ref">Dhp.324</span>.
The ancient Indians revered the elephant for its strength, nobility and intelligence and elephants are mentioned in the Tipiṭaka more than any other animal. Elephants lived in certain forests <span class="ref">M.iii.132</span>, probably because they offered better shelter, food and water than other places. Males were believed to avoid the cows and their calves so that they would not be bothered by them or have to eat the leaves and grass that they had already cropped or drink the water they had muddied <span class="ref">A.iv.435</span>. It was noticed that elephants have very particular behavior; when they charge they spread their ears and make their tails erect <span class="ref">Vin.ii.194</span>, they sniff the dung of other elephants <span class="ref">A.iii.157</span> and they dislike heat <span class="ref">D.ii.266</span>. Males regularly go into must when temporin flows from their ears <span class="ref">Dhp.324</span> and they become aggressive and unruly so that their mahouts have to hold them in check <span class="ref">Dhp.326</span>. At such times they may kill people or even knock down dwellings <span class="ref">Ja.iv.494</span>. Elephants enjoy swimming and they amuse 
themselves by squirting water into their ears and over their backs <span class="ref">A.v.201</span>. They pull up lotus stalks, wash them to get the mud off and then eat them <span class="ref">S.ii.269</span>. A bull elephant might be seven or eight cubits high <span class="ref">A.v.201</span> and some could live for 60 years or more <span class="ref">M.i.229</span>.
Elephants were domesticated in India at least 1,500 years before the Buddha’s time. Trackers skilled in reading the marks left by them - footprints, the scrapings of their tusks on trees, broken foliage, etc - were employed to find the animals <span class="ref">M.i.178</span>. Domesticated elephants would be used to capture the wild ones <span class="ref">M.iii.132</span>. Once caught, the trainer had to subdue the creature’s forest habits, memories and behavior, subdue its distress, fret and fever over missing the forest, and get it used to towns and people. The tamer used gentle kind words and the elephant would gradually respond and begin eating again. Then the trainer would teach the elephant commands like “Take up!” “Put down!” “Go forward!” “Go back!” “Get up!” “Sit down!” After that, it would be taught what was called “endurance.” A plank was tied to the elephant’s trunk, a man would sit on its back and then it would be surrounded by other men who would poke it with poles and spears and make a great racket while the trainer would command it not 
to move <span class="ref">M.iii.132-33</span>. To mount a trained elephant the mahout would take his hook and say: “Give me your foot” and the elephant would bend its knee so the mahout climbs on its back <span class="ref">Thi.49</span>. When domesticated elephants heard the roar of the lion they would strain at and break the leather bonds that held them, defecate, panic and run around <span class="ref">A.ii.32</span>. Because of their value, there were veterinarians specializing in elephant health <span class="ref">Ja.i.485</span>. Ivory was a much-prized product. Bracelets, boxes for eye-salve, caskets, ornament boxes in fantastic shapes, vases and anklets were made out of it. There is mention of a mirror handle being made out of ivory <span class="ref">Ja.v.302</span>. There was a bazaar of ivory workers in Vārānasi <span class="ref">Ja.i.320</span>. A type of curved wall peg was called “elephant tusk” <span class="ref">Vin.ii.113</span> and one way of wearing the monks” under robe was to role it up at the front rather than fold it, a style known as “the elephant’s trunk” <span class="ref">Vin.ii.136</span>. The capitals of pillars in buildings were sometimes carved to resemble 
elephants <span class="ref">Vin.ii.169</span>.
Domesticated elephants were used for work, transportation, in warfare and to enhance royal glory. The elephant brigade was one of the four traditional branches of the army, the others being cavalry, chariots and infantry <span class="ref">D.i.137</span>. Being crushed by an elephant was a form of capital punishment <span class="ref">J.i.200</span>. In battle, elephants would take great care to protect their softest and most vulnerable part, their trunk <span class="ref">M.i.415</span>. A large tusked elephant was an essential possession for a monarch. King Ajātasattu rode his royal tusker from Rājagaha to meet the Buddha at Jīvaka’s Mango Grove <span class="ref">D.i.49</span>. Once, the Buddha and Ānanda were bathing in the river at Sāvatthī when Seta, King Pasenadi’s elephant, arrived to the accompaniment of music. Soon an admiring crowd had gathered to watch, commenting “What a beauty! What a sight! What a delight for the eye! What a body! Now that really is an elephant!” <span class="ref">A.iii.345</span>. An elephant fit to be a royal mount in war had to have four qualities. It had to respond well to training. In 
battle it had to destroy other elephants and their mahouts as well as cavalry, chariots and their drivers and footmen. It was expected to endure the injuries of spears, swords, arrows and axes and the din of drums, conchs and other noises, and it was expected to go in whichever direction the mahout directed it <span class="ref">A.ii.115</span>.</p>
<p>One of the skills taught to princes along with horsemanship, archery, swordsmanship and chariot driving, was the art of training, riding and caring for elephants <span class="ref">A.iii.152</span>. This was called elephant lore <span class="ref">A.iii.326</span>. During a food shortage the king’s elephant died and people ate it <span class="ref">Vin.i.218</span>. The rare white elephant was particularly prized <span class="ref">Ja.i.319</span> and one of the accoutrements of a universal Monarch was a pure white elephant of sevenfold strength <span class="ref">D.ii.174</span>. The mount of Indra, the king of the gods, was a magnificent elephant named Erāvana <span class="ref">Sn.379</span> or sometimes Maghavā. <span class="ref">S.i.229</span>. Some lay people were rich enough to be able to own elephants. When Soṇa became a monk, he said he had renounced everything he owned including “a herd of seven elephants”, the implication being that he had been very wealthy <span class="ref">Vin.i.184</span>.</p>
<p>The Buddha seems to have had a special fondness for elephants. The animal’s mindful and deliberate behavior and particularly the male’s penchant for living alone in the jungle, impressed him. “On this matter the enlightened sage and the elephant with tusks as long as plough poles agree, they both love the solitude of the forest” <span class="ref">Ud.42</span>. In some ways the Buddha even considered elephants to be better than humans. The elephant trainer Pessa once said to him: “Humans are a tangle while animals are straightforward. I can drive an elephant undergoing training and in the time it takes to make a trip to and from Campa, that elephant will display every kind of deception, duplicity, trickery and fraud. But our servants, messengers and employees, they say one thing, do another and think something else.” The Buddha agreed with this observation <span class="ref">M.i.340</span>. He often compared himself to or was compared by others with an elephant <span class="ref">A.ii.36</span>. When Doṇa encountered him sitting at the foot of a tree, he appeared “beautiful, 
faith-inspiring, with calm senses and a serene mind, utterly composed and controlled like a tamed, alert, perfectly trained elephant” <span class="ref">A.ii.36</span>. The Buddha never looked over his shoulder when he wanted to see behind him but turned around completely as does an elephant. This was called his “elephant look” <span class="ref">D.ii.122</span>.</p>
<p>Throughout the Tipiṭaka, the Buddha advised his disciples to respond to difficulties as would an elephant. “I shall endure abuse as a bull elephant in battle endures the arrows shot from the bow. For indeed, ill-natured people are many”<span class="ref">Dhp.320</span>. “Formerly this mind wandered wherever it wished, where it liked and as it pleased. But today I shall completely control it as a mahout controls an elephant in must” <span class="ref">Dhp.326</span>. “Rejoice in awareness and guard your mind well. Pull yourself out of evil as does an elephant stuck in the mud” <span class="ref">Dhp.327</span>. “If you do not find a wise, zealous and virtuous companion to wander with, then like a king abandoning his conquered realm, wander alone like a bull elephant in the forest” <span class="ref">Dhp.329</span>.
Elephants are frequently mentioned in the Jātaka where they are usually depicted as noble, kindly and intelligent creatures. According to the Jātakas, the Bodhisattva was sometimes reborn as an elephant <span class="ref">Ja.i.319</span> <span class="ref">Ja.i.444</span> <span class="ref">Ja.iii.174</span> <span class="ref">Ja.iv.90</span> and once as a human he worked as an elephant trainer <span class="ref">Ja.ii.94</span>.</p></dd></dl>

<dd><p>The fruit of the Chebulic or Yellow Myrobalan, Hindi <em>haritaki</em>, <em>Terminalia chebula</em> <span class="ref">J.i.80</span> <span class="ref">M.iii.127</span>, a medium-sized tree usually with a short crooked trunk, dark-gray bark, elliptic leaves and whitish flowers. Together with <em><a href="#%C4%81malaka">āmalaka</a></em> and <em><a href="#vibh%C4%ABtaka">vibhītaka</a></em> the fruit of this tree is one of the “<em>triphalā</em>” or three fruits, long credited in traditional Indian medicine with powerful curative properties. When ripe, the bright-yellow fruits are allowed to fall and then collected and used in tanning and as a medicine. While staying at Uruvelā the Buddha plucked a yellow myrobalan fruit <span class="ref">Vin.i.30</span>. According to the <em>Mahāvastu</em>, the Buddha planted a Yellow Myrobalan tree when he was at Uruvelā. It adds the comment: “The myrobalans which grew from this tree are today known as the Consecrated Myrobalan Wood”<span class="ref">Mvu.iii.311</span>.
When the Chinese monk Yijing was in India in the 7<sup>th</sup> century he was told of ways to use yellow myrobalan as a medicine. “Take equal measures of <em>harītaka</em> bark, dry ginger and granulated sugar. Pound the first two into a powder and mix it with the sugar and some water and then form the paste into pills. Take no more than ten pills in the morning and do not abstain from eating. No more than two or three doses will be sufficient to cure a patient with diarrhea. It will dissolve the gas in the stomach, dispense cold and help digestion... If no granulated sugar is available maltose or honey can be used. If one chews one piece of <em>harītaka</em> and swallows the juice every day, one will be free from disease the whole of one’s life.”</p></dd>
