<meta name="description" content="This is a revised version of Malalasekera's Dictionary of Pali Proper Names. It was prepared for SuttaCentral in May/June 2013 in order to have a more machine-readable, consistent text that omitted the very many later references. It was prepared on the basis of a digital version of the DPPN supplied as part of Bhikkhu Yuttadhammo's Digital Pali Reader. Pali diacriticals were mainly added by Venerable Nandiya. Proofread by Ayya Araññadevi 2015. Editing was by Bhikkhu Sujato. The main changes were to delete all entries and references within entries that refer to late texts. Only references found in the four Nikayas, early books of the Khuddaka, and the Vinaya were retained. Usually this meant simply deleting unnecessary material, but in many cases, especially in the Thera/Therigatha, the later material was almost the entire entry, so they had to be rewritten. Minor changes include miscellaneous corrections, deletion of Pali terms, and simplifying entries. Certain long entries were drastically shortened, such as Buddha, Ananda, Pasenadi, etc. The text is in an XML format based on KML, and with the inclusion of geodata is intended as a basis for a map application. Variant readings have been included for some names: these are intended to be inclusive so as to pick up any spelling variant that might occur, and should not be regarded as genuine variants in the texts. While many entries were checked this is not a thorough revision of the original, and further improvements are invited. If you want to make any changes, please let me know so that I can keep an up to date file: sujato@gmail.com">

<meta name="description" content="In this file the precision field indicates the approximate degree of precision with which a location is known. Values are: 1=precisely known; 2=imprecisely but uniquely known; 3=imprecisely and non-uniquely known; 4=unknown; 5=unknowable. The purpose of this field is to determine how each case is to be plotted on a map. Precision 1 may be placed unproblematically; P2 may be placed with an indication that it is approximate. P3 cannot be placed on a general map, but may be located within a larger space. P4 and P5 may not be plotted. Typical example of each case are: 1=Sāvatthī; 2=a stop on a journey, such as that of Bavari's students. Some of these places are not known exactly, but we can usefully plot their approximate location on a map; 3=a town in Magadha: since there are many such towns that are not further specified, we cannot plot these uniquely on a map, but we can indicate their general region; 4=places about which nothing is known; 5=places such as heavens, hells, and the like, which are not plottable with earthly geography.... While P1 and P2 are indicated with geolocation numbers, P3 is indicated by reference to another place in or near which it is located. Places are of zero dimensions (towns, etc.), one dimension (rivers, journeys), or two dimensions (regions). Rivers may sometimes be identified with extant rivers. Journeys are not extant features, so must be plotted as independent entities. Regions are sometimes geographic features (mountain ranges, desert), sometimes political (countries). The distinction between a district, region, or politically distinct nation is not always clear, so we use region for all these. The exception is the 16 janapadas. These are a subset of regions, but mentioned as a set. Their approximate boundaries can be plotted.">

<p>Son of Bimbisāra, King of Māgadha, and therefore half-brother to Abhayarājakumāra. He murdered his father to gain the throne, and conspired with Devadatta to kill the Buddha, but was later converted. He had a son Udāyibhadda. <span class="ref">DN.i.50</span></p><p>Ajātasattu was greatly impressed by Devadatta’s powers of <i>iddhi</i> and became his devoted follower. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.185</span> He built for him a monastery at Gayāsīsa and waited upon him morning and evening carrying food for him, sometimes as much as five hundred cartloads in five hundred cooking pans. <span class="ref">SN.ii.242</span></p><p>Devadatta incited him to seize the throne, killing his father if necessary. When Bimbisāra learnt of the prince’s intentions he abdicated in his favour.

And when in the end he did go to the Buddha, it was in great fear and trembling; so nervous was he that he imagined conspirators in the very silence surrounding the Buddha where he dwelt in the monastery, in Jīvaka’s Mango grove at Rājagaha. <span class="ref">DN.i.49–50</span></p><p>It was on the occasion of this visit that the Sāmaññaphala Sutta was preached. The king admits that he had been to various teachers before, but had failed to find satisfaction in their teachings. It is noteworthy that the Buddha greets the king cordially on his arrival and makes no mention whatever of the king’s impiety. Instead, when Ajātasattu expresses his repentance at the end of the discourse, the Buddha accepts his confession and lets him off almost too lightly. But after the king had departed the Buddha tells the monks how the king’s misdeeds had wrought his undoing both in this world and the next, for if he had not been guilty of them, the Eye of Truth would have been opened for him on the occasion of this sermon. <span class="ref">DN.i.85–8​6</span></p><p>Henceforth the king became a loyal adherent of the Buddha’s faith, though, as far as we know, he never waited again either upon the Buddha or upon any member of the Order for the discussion of ethical matters. He was so full of love and respect for the Buddha that when he heard of Upaka Maṇḍikāputta having spoken rather impolitely to the Buddha, he at once flew into a rage. <span class="ref">AN.ii.182</span></p><p>Bimbisāra had married a sister of Pasenadi, and when he was killed she died of grief.</p><p>The revenue of a Kāsī village had been given to her by her father, Mahākosala, as part of her dowry, but after Bimbisāra’s murder, Pasenadi refused to continue it. Thereupon Ajātasattu declared war on his uncle. Before this, uncle and nephew seem to have been on very friendly terms. Once Ajātasattu sent Pasenadi a wonderful piece of foreign fabric, sixteen cubits long and eight broad, mounted on a pole to serve as a canopy. This Pasenadi gave to Ānanda. <span class="ref">MN.ii.116</span></p><p>At first he was victorious in three battles, but, later, he was defeated by Pasenadi, who followed the military advice of an old monk, the Elder Dhanuggahatissa; Ajātasattu was taken captive with his army. On giving an undertaking not to resort to violence again, he was released, and to seal the friendship, Pasenadi gave him his daughter Vajirā as wife, and the revenue of the disputed village was gifted to her as bath-money. <span class="ref">SN.i.82–85</span></p><p>Later, when through the treachery of Pasenadi’s minister, Dīgha Kārāyana, his son Viḍūḍabha usurped the throne, Pasenadi, finding himself deserted, went towards Rājagaha to seek Ajātasattu’s help, but on the way he died of exposure and Ajātasattu gave him burial.</p><p>About a year before the Buddha’s death, Ajātasattu sent his chief minister and confidant, the brahmin Vassakāra, to the Buddha to intimate to him his desire to make war on the Vajjians and to find out what prediction the Buddha would make regarding his chances of victory. The Buddha informed the brahmin that the Vajjians practised the seven conditions of welfare which they had learnt from him, and that they were therefore invincible. <span class="ref">DN.ii.72<em>f.</em></span> The Saṃyutta Nikāya mentions the Buddha as saying that the time would come when the Vajjians would relinquish their strenuous mode of living and that then would come Ajātasattu’s chance. <span class="ref">SN.ii.268</span></p><p>Rumours are mentioned of King Candappajjota making preparations for a war on Ajātasattu to avenge the death of his friend Bimbisāra, but no mention is made of actual fighting. <span class="ref">MN.iii.7</span></p><p>It was he who built the fortress of Pāṭāliputta, which later became the capital of Māgadha.</p>

<dd>
<p>A banker (<i>seṭṭhi</i>) of Sāvatthī who became famous because of his unparalleled generosity to the Buddha. His first meeting with the Buddha was during the first year after the Enlightenment, in Rājagaha., <span class="ref">Vin.ii.154<em>ff.</em></span> whither Anāthapiṇḍika had come on business.</p><p>His wife was the sister of the seṭṭhi of Rājagaha, and when he arrived he found the seṭṭhi preparing a meal for the Buddha and his monks on so splendid a scale that he thought that a wedding was in progress or that the king had been invited. On learning the truth he became eager to visit the Buddha, and did so very early the next morning. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.155–156</span> He was so excited by the thought of the visit that he got up three times during the night. When, at last, he started for Sītavana, the road was quite dark, but a friendly Yakkha, Sīvaka, sped him on with words of encouragement. By force of his piety the darkness vanished.</p><p>The Buddha was staying in the Sītavana, and when Anāthapiṇḍika reached there spirits opened the door for him. He found the Buddha walking up and down, meditating in the cool air of the early dawn. The Buddha greeted him and talked to him on various aspects of his teaching. Anāthapiṇḍika was immediately converted and became a Sotāpanna. He invited the Buddha to a meal the next day, providing everything himself, although the seṭṭhi, the Mayor of Rājagaha and King Bimbisāra asked to be allowed to help. After the meal, which he served to the Buddha with his own hand, he invited the Buddha to spend the rainy season at Sāvatthī, and the Buddha accepted, saying “the Tathāgatas, o householder, take pleasure in solitude.” “I understand, o Blessed One, I understand,” was the reply.</p><p>When Anāthapiṇḍika had finished his business at Rājagaha he set out towards Sāvatthī, giving orders along the way to his friends and acquaintances to prepare dwellings, parks, rest-houses and gifts all along the road to Sāvatthī in preparation for the Buddha’s visit. He had many friends and acquaintances and he was <i>ādeyyavaco</i> (his word was held to be of weight). <span class="ref">Vin.ii.158</span></p><p>Understanding the request implied in the Buddha’s words when he accepted the invitation, Anāthapiṇḍika looked out for a quiet spot near Sāvatthī where the Buddha and the monks might dwell, and his eye fell on the park of Jetakumāra. He bought the park at great expense and erected therein the famous Jetavanārāma. As a result of this and of his numerous other benefactions in the cause of the Sāsana, Anāthapiṇḍika came to be recognised as the chief of alms-givers. <span class="ref">AN.i.25</span></p><p>Anāthapiṇḍika’s personal name was Sudatta, but he was always called Anāthapiṇḍika (feeder of the destitute) because of his munificence; he was, however, very pleased when the Buddha addressed him by his own name. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.156</span> He spent eighteen crores on the purchase of Jetavana and a like sum on the construction of the <i>vihāra</i>; another eighteen crores were spent in the festival of dedication. He fed one hundred monks in his house daily in addition to meals provided for guests, people of the village, invalids, etc.</p>

<dd>
<p>First cousin of the Buddha and one of his most eminent disciples. He was the son of the Sākyan Amitodana and brother of Mahānāma. When members of other Sākyan families had joined the Order of their distinguished kinsman, Mahānāma was grieved that none had gone forth from his own. He therefore suggested to his brother that one of them should leave household life. Anuruddha was at first reluctant to agree, for he had been reared most delicately and luxuriously, dwelling in a different house for each season, surrounded by dancers and mimes. But on hearing from Mahānāma of the endless round of household cares he agreed to go. He could not, however, get his mother’s consent until he persuaded his cousin Bhaddiya to go with him. Together they went with Ānanda, Bhagu, Kimbila, Devadatta and their barber Upāli, to the Blessed One at the Anupiya Mango Grove and were ordained. Before the rainy season was over Anuruddha acquired the divine eye. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.180–18​3</span> He was later ranked foremost among those who had obtained this attainment. <span class="ref">AN.i.23</span></p><p>He then received from Sāriputta, as topic of meditation, the eight thoughts of a great man. <span class="ref">AN.iv.228<em>ff.</em></span> Another conversation he had with Sāriputta before becoming an arahant is reported. <span class="ref">AN.i.281–282</span> He went into the Pācīnavaṃsadāya in the Ceti country to practise these. He mastered seven, but could not learn the eighth. The Buddha, being aware of this, visited him and taught it to him. Thereupon Anuruddha developed insight and realised arahantship in the highest grade. <span class="ref">AN.iv.228<em>ff.</em></span> <span class="ref">Thag.901</span></p><p>When the Buddha, disgusted with the quarrels of the Kosambī monks, went away to seek more congenial surroundings, it was to Pācīnavaṃsadāya that he repaired, where were Anuruddha, Nandiya and Kimbila. The Upakkilesa Sutta, <span class="ref">MN.iii.153<em>f.</em></span> on the sweets of concord and freedom from blemish, seems to have been preached specially to Anuruddha on that occasion, for we are told at the end that he was pleased to have heard it, no mention being made of the other two. And again in the Naḷakapāna Sutta, <span class="ref">MN.i.462<em>ff.</em></span> though a large number of distinguished monks are present, it is to Anuruddha that the Buddha directly addresses his questions, and it is Anuruddha who answers on behalf of them all. See also the Cūḷa—​​and the Mahā-Gosiṅga Suttas.</p><p>Anuruddha was present when the Buddha died at Kusinārā, and knew the exact moment of his death; the verse he uttered on that occasion is thoughtful and shows philosophic calm, in contrast, for example, with that of Ānanda. <span class="ref">DN.ii.156–157</span></p><p>Anuruddha was foremost in consoling the monks and admonishing them as to their future course of action. It was Anuruddha again that the Mallas of Kusinārā consulted regarding the Buddha’s last obsequies. <span class="ref">DN.ii.160<em>f.</em></span></p><p>In one of the verses ascribed to Anuruddha in the Theragāthā <span class="ref">Thag.904</span> it is said that for twenty-five years he did not sleep at all, and that for the last thirty years of his life he slept only during the last watch of the night.</p><p>The Anuruddha Saṃyutta <span class="ref">SN.v.294</span> gives an account of a series of questions asked by Moggallāna on the <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i>, their extent, etc. Anuruddha evidently laid great emphasis on the cultivation of the <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i>, for we find mention of them occurring over and over again in his discourses. He attributes all his powers to their development, and admonishes his hearers to practise them. <span class="ref">SN.v.299–306</span> He himself considered the divine eye as the highest attainment. Thus in the Mahāgosiṅga Sutta <span class="ref">MN.i.213</span> he declares it to be more worthy than knowledge of the doctrine, meditation, forest-life, discourse on the abhidhamma or self-mastery.</p><p>Once he lay grievously ill in the Andhavana in Sāvatthī, but the pain made no impression on his mind, because, he says, his mind was well grounded in the <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i>. <span class="ref">SN.v.302</span> Apart from his teaching of the <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i>, he does not seem to have found fame as a teacher. He was of a retiring disposition and never interfered in any of the monks’ quarrels.</p><p>Mention is often made of Anuruddha’s <i>iddhi</i>-powers. Thus, he was one of those who went to the Brahma-world to curb the pride of the Brahma who had thought that no ascetic could reach his world. <span class="ref">SN.i.145</span> (The others being Moggallāna, Mahākassapa and Mahākappina.) The mother of the Yakkha Piyaṅkara, while wandering in search of food, heard him at night reciting some verses from the Dhammapada and stood spellbound listening. <span class="ref">SN.i.209</span></p><p>His <i>iddhi</i>, however, does not seem to have enabled him to prevent his fellow-dweller Abhiñjika from talking too much, <span class="ref">SN.ii.203–204</span> nor his other fellow-dweller Bāhiya from attempting to create dissension in the Order. <span class="ref">AN.ii.239</span> Among the Vajjians he seems to have been held particularly in esteem, together with Nandiya and Kimbila. A <i>yakkha</i> named Dīgha tells the Buddha how the Vajjians are envied by the inhabitants of the deva and brahma worlds on account of the presence of these distinguished monks in their country. <span class="ref">MN.i.210</span></p>

Between it and Rājagaha is the river Sappinī, which rises in the Gijjhakūṭa. <span class="ref">Vin.i.109</span> Once the Buddha went from Benares to Andhakavinda with 1,250 monks, and many people followed them carrying cartloads of provisions that they might feed them in turn. There were so many awaiting their turn that a certain brahmin (referred to as Andhakavindabrāhmana) had to wait two months for his to come round. At the end of two months, finding that his own affairs were going to ruin and that there was no likelihood of his turn coming soon, the brahmin went to the provision-room to see what deficiency he could possibly supply. Seeing there neither rice, milk, nor honey-lumps, he approached Ānanda, and having, through him, obtained the Buddha’s permission, the brahmin prepared a meal of milk-rice and honey-lumps for the Buddha and the monks. At the conclusion of the meal the Buddha spoke of the tenfold good qualities of milk-rice. <span class="ref">Vin.i.220<em>f.</em></span> It was this praise uttered by the Buddha that made Visākhā ask him, as a favour, that she should be allowed to supply milk-rice to the monks throughout her life. <span class="ref">Vin.i.293</span></p><p>During the same visit of the Buddha, a newly converted minister of the district prepared meat dishes for the fraternity, but being disappointed that the monks, who had had a meal of solid milk-rice earlier, could not eat large quantities of his dishes, he was rather rude to them. Later he expressed remorse, and the Buddha assured him that heaven would be his inheritance <span class="ref">Vin.i.222<em>f.</em></span> (This was the occasion for the rule that monks who have been invited to a meal in one place should not accept milk-rice somewhere else earlier in the same day.)

<p>A brahmin youth of the Ambaṭṭha clan who lived with his teacher, Pokkharasādi, at Ukkaṭṭha.

It appears that Ambaṭṭha had once gone on some business of Pokkharasādi’s to Kapilavatthu, to the Mote Hall of the Sākyans, and had been insulted there. <span class="ref">DN.i.91</span></p><p>Asked by the Buddha to what family he belonged, Ambaṭṭha replied that he came of the Kaṇhāyanā-gotta; thereupon the Buddha traced the family back to its ancestor, who had been the offspring of a slave girl of Okkāka, named Disā. The child had been able to talk as soon as he was born and, because of this devilish trait, had been called Kaṇha (devil), hence the family name. Kaṇha later became a mighty seer and married Maddarūpi, daughter of Okkāka. <span class="ref">DN.i.96–97</span></p><p>Ambaṭṭha makes no remonstrance against this genealogy and, under pressure, accepts it as true. This gives the Buddha an opportunity of preaching on the futility of feeling vanity regarding one’s caste and on the worth of morality and conduct.</p><p>At the end of the discourse the Buddha walked up and down outside his chamber so that Ambaṭṭha might see on his body the thirty-two signs of a great man. Ambaṭṭha goes back to Pokkharasadi and reports the whole interview. Pokkharasādi is greatly incensed, abuses Ambaṭṭha and kicks him. Later Pokkharasādi goes himself to the Buddha and invites him for a meal. At the end of the meal the Buddha instructs him in his Doctrine and is accepted as the Teacher both of Pokkharasādi himself and of his followers and dependants at Ukkaṭṭha.

While the Buddha was yet in Bhaddavatikā the Elder Sāgata went to the Jaṭila’s hermitage and took up his abode near the fireplace. The Nāga showed his resentment, but Sāgata was able to overcome him by means of his <i>iddhi</i>-powers. Later Sāgata visited the Buddha at Bhaddavatikā and went with him to Kosambī. The fame of the Elder’s victory over the Nāga had preceded him and the inhabitants of Kosambī were lavish in their hospitality to him. He drank wine in their houses and had to be carried to see the Buddha.

The Buddha accepted this invitation and had, as a result, to refuse that of the Licchavis of Vesāli.</p><p>While returning from her visit to the Buddha, Ambapālī was so elated at the idea of having the Buddha to a meal the next day, that she refused to make way for the Licchavi princes who were on their way to the Buddha. She refused to give up her invitation for anything in the world. Just before Ambapālī’s visit to him, the Buddha admonished the monks to be steadfast and mindful, lest they should lose their heads about her.</p><p>It was after this meal that Ambapālī gave over her park, the Ambapālivana, to the Buddha and the Order. The Buddha accepted the gift and stayed there some time before going on to Beluva. <span class="ref">Vin.i.231–233</span> <span class="ref">DN.ii.95–9​8</span></p><p>Nineteen verses ascribed to her are found in the Therīgāthā. <span class="ref">Thig.252–2​70</span></p><p>It is said that she charged fifty <i>kahāpanas</i> a night from her patrons and that Vesāli became very prosperous through her. It was this that prompted Bimbisāra to get a courtesan for his own city of Rājagaha. <span class="ref">Vin.i.268</span></p>

Surely the Buddha who is an arahant, etc., could make the whole world go to heaven thus if he chose. To this the Buddha answers no, and explains, by various similes, that only a man’s kamma can determine where he will be reborn. On another occasion, the Buddha tells him, in answer to a question, that the Buddha teaches the Dhamma in full only to certain disciples and not to others; just as a farmer sowing seed selects, first the best field, then the moderate, and lastly, the field with the worst soil.</p><p>Asibandhakaputta is said to be a disciple of the Jains, and tells the Buddha that, according to Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta <span class="ref">SN.iv.317</span> as a man habitually lives so goes he forth to his destiny. The Buddha points out the absurdity of this view and tells him that all Tathāgatas lay down definite rules for the guidance of their followers, so that they may attain development.</p><p>It is recorded <span class="ref">SN.iv.322<em>ff.</em></span> that once, when Nāḷandā was stricken with famine, Asibandhaka visited Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, who asks him to go and defeat the Buddha in debate. Asibandhaka is at first reluctant, but his teacher propounds to him a dilemma to put to the Buddha, and he agrees to go.</p><p>Is it true that the Buddha extols compassion to clansmen? Why, then, does the Buddha ask for alms in a place stricken with famine? The Buddha’s answer is that there are eight ways of injuring clansmen, and that begging for alms is not one of them.

<p>In Pali Literature the Asuras are classed among the inferior deities together with the <i>supaṇṇas</i>, <i>gandhabbas</i>, <i>yakkhas</i>, <i>garuḍas</i> and <i>nāgas</i>. Rebirth as an Asura is considered as one of the four unhappy rebirths or evil states (<i>apāya</i>), the others being hell, animal, and ghost realms. <span class="ref">It.93</span></p><p>The fight between the Devas and the Asuras is mentioned even in the oldest books of the Tipitaka and is described in identical words in several passages. <span class="ref">DN.ii.285</span> <span class="ref">SN.i.222</span> <span class="ref">SN.iv.201<em>ff.</em></span> <span class="ref">SN.v.447</span> <span class="ref">MN.i.253</span> <span class="ref">DN.ii.2851</span> <span class="ref">DN.ii.2853</span></p><p>A chief or king of the Asuras is often referred to as Asurinda, several Asuras being credited with the role of leader, most commonly, however, Vepacitti <span class="ref">SN.i.222</span> <span class="ref">SN.iv.201<em>ff.</em></span> and Rāhu. <span class="ref">AN.ii.17</span> <span class="ref">AN.ii.53</span> <span class="ref">AN.iii.243</span> Besides these we find Pahārāda, <span class="ref">AN.iv.197</span> <span class="ref">AN.iv.200</span> Sambara, <span class="ref">SN.i.227</span> Verocana, <span class="ref">SN.i.225</span> Bali, <span class="ref">DN.ii.259</span> Sucitti, <span class="ref">DN.ii.269</span> and Namucī. <span class="ref">DN.ii.269</span></p><p>There were evidently several classes of Asuras, and two are mentioned in the Pitakas, the Kālakañjakas and the Dānaveghasas.

<dt><dfn>Assajipunabbasukā</dfn></dt>
<dd>
<p>The followers of Assaji and Punabbasu. They lived in Kīṭāgiri, between Sāvatthī and Ālavi, and were guilty of various evil practices. They used to grow flowers, make wreaths and garlands, and send them to girls and women of respectable families and also to slave girls, to lie with such women, and disregard the precepts regarding the eating of food at the wrong time, using perfumes, visiting shows, singing and playing games of various sorts. Their abandoned ways of life won popularity for them, and virtuous monks, who did not belong to their group, were not welcomed by the people of the neighbourhood.</p><p>The Buddha heard of their nefarious doings from a monk who had been sojourning in the district, and having convened a meeting of the Saṅgha, sent Sāriputta and Moggallāna, together with a number of other monks, (for the recalcitrant were passionate and violent), to carry out the <i>Pabbājanīyakamma</i> (Act of Banishment) against them. The deputation of the Saṅgha went to Kīṭāgiri and made an order that the Assaji-Punabbasukā should no longer dwell there, but the latter, instead of obeying the injunction, abused the monks, accusing them of partiality, and not only departed from Kīṭāgiri, but also left the Order. When the matter was reported to the Buddha he had the Pabbājanīyakamma revoked. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.9–13</span> <span class="ref">Vin.ii.14</span> <span class="ref">Vin.ii.15</span></p><p>The Assaji-Punabbasukas seem to have had a special dislike for Sāriputta and Moggallāna. Once the Buddha, on his way somewhere from Sāvatthī, accompanied by Sāriputta, Moggallāna and five hundred others, sent word to the Assaji-Punabbasukas to prepare sleeping places for them. They sent answer that the Buddha was very welcome, but not Sāriputta and Moggallāna, because “they were men of sinful desires and influenced by such desires.”. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.171</span></p><p>But elsewhere <span class="ref">MN.i.473<em>ff.</em></span> even the Buddha is represented as having been lightly regarded by them. When it was reported to them that the Buddha lived on only one meal a day and found that it made him well and healthy, their reply was that they themselves ate in the evening and the early morning and at noon and outside prescribed hours, and that they found this quite agreeable and saw no reason for changing their mode of life. It is true, however, that even on this occasion when the Buddha sent for them, they came dutifully and listened patiently to his admonition on the necessity of implicit obedience to a teacher in whom they had faith, and we are told that they were “even gladdened in their hearts” after hearing the Buddha. There is, however, no evidence that they reformed after hearing him.</p>

<p>The fifth of the Pañcavaggiyā monks. When the Buddha preached the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, he was the last in whom dawned the eye of Truth, and the Buddha had to discourse to him and to Mahānāma while their three colleagues went for alms. <span class="ref">Vin.i.13</span> He became an arahant, together with the others, at the preaching of the Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta. <span class="ref">Vin.i.14</span></p><p>He was responsible for the conversion of Sāriputta and Moggallāna. Sāriputta, in the course of his wanderings, saw Assaji begging for alms in Rājagaha, and being pleased with his demeanour, followed him till he had finished his round. Finding a suitable opportunity, Sāriputta asked Assaji about his teacher and the doctrines he followed. Assaji was at first reluctant to preach to him, because, as he said, he was but young in the Order. But Sāriputta urged him to say what he knew, and the stanza which Assaji uttered then, has, ever since, been famous, as representing the keynote of the Buddha’s teaching:</p><p><i>“ye dhammā hetuppabhavā tesam hetum Tathāgato āha tesañ ca yo nirodho, evaṃvādī Mahāsamano.”</i></p><p>Sāriputta immediately understood and hurried to give the glad tidings to Moggallāna that he had succeeded in his quest. <span class="ref">Vin.i.39<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>One day when Assaji was going about in Vesāli for alms, the Nigaṇṭha Saccaka, who was wandering about in search of disputants to conquer, saw him, and questioned him regarding the Buddha’s teaching because he was a well-known disciple Assaji gave him a summary of the doctrine contained in the Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta. Feeling sure that he could refute these views attributed to the Buddha, Saccaka went with a large concourse of Licchavis to the Buddha and questioned him. This was the occasion for the preaching of the Cūḷa-Saccaka Sutta. <span class="ref">MN.i.227<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>The Saṃyutta Nikāya <span class="ref">SN.iii.124<em>ff.</em></span> records a visit paid by the Buddha to Assaji as he lay grievously sick in Kassapārāma near Rājagaha. He tells the Buddha that he cannot enter into <i>jhāna</i> because of his difficulty in breathing and that he cannot win balance of mind. The Buddha encourages him and asks him to dwell on thoughts of impermanence and non-self.</p>

<p>A class of naked ascetics, <span class="ref">Vin.i.291</span> followers of Makkhali Gosāla, regarded, from the Buddhist point of view, as the worst of sophists. Numerous references to the Ājīvakas are to be found in the Pitakas, only a few of them being at all complimentary. Thus in the Mahā Saccaka Sutta <span class="ref">MN.i.238</span> they are spoken of as going about naked, flouting life’s decencies and licking their hands after meals.</p><p>It is stated in the Tevijja Vacchagotta Sutta <span class="ref">MN.i.483</span> that far from any Ājīvaka having put an end to sorrow, the Buddha could recall only one Ājīvaka during ninety-nine kappas who had even gone to heaven, and that one too had preached a doctrine of kamma and the after-consequences of actions. Elsewhere <span class="ref">MN.i.524</span> they are spoken of as children of a childless mother. They extol themselves and disparage others and yet they have produced only three shining lights: Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Saṅkicca, Makkhali Gosāla. A fourth leader, Paṇḍuputta, of wagon-building stock, is mentioned in the Anaṅgaṇa Sutta <span class="ref">MN.i.31</span> ; there is also the well-known Upaka.</p><p>There is no doubt that the Ājīvaka were highly esteemed and had large followings of disciples.<span class="ref">SN.i.68</span> <span class="ref">SN.iv.398</span> They had eminent followers such as high court officials. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.166</span> <span class="ref">Vin.iv.71</span></p><p>The doctrines held by the Ājīvaka are mentioned in several places, but the best known account is in the Sāmaññaphala Sutta where they are attributed to Makkhali Gosāla by name <span class="ref">DN.i.53–5​4</span> <span class="ref">MN.i.516<em>f.</em></span> He maintained that there is no cause or reason for either depravity or purity among beings. There is no such thing as intrinsic strength, or energy or human might or endeavour. All creatures, all beings, everything that has life, all are devoid of power, strength and energy; all are under the compulsion of the individual nature to which they are linked by destiny; it is solely by virtue of their birth in the six environments (<i>chalabhijātiyo</i>) that they experience their pleasure or pain. The universe is divided into various classes of beings, of occupations and methods of production. There are eighty-four hundred thousand periods during which both fools and wise alike, wandering in transmigration, shall at last make an end of pain. The pleasures and pain, measured out as it were with a measure, cannot be altered in the course of transmigration; there can be neither increase nor decrease thereof, neither excess nor deficiency.</p><p>The fundamental point in their teaching seems, therefore, to have been “<i>saṃsāra-suddhi</i>,” purification through transmigration, which probably meant that all beings, all lives, all existent things, all living substances attain and must attain, perfection in course of time.</p>

Ārāmadaṇḍa stood up with clasped hands and, turning in the direction of Sāvatthī, he uttered his adoration of the Buddha. Thenceforward he became a disciple of Mahā Kaccāna. A.i.65–67.</p>

The Buddha, on several occasions, stayed at Āḷavī at the Aggālava shrine, which was near the town. The town later became famous as the residence of Āḷavaka Yakkha and of Hatthaka Āḷavaka. The Therī, Selā was born in Āḷavī and was therefore known as Aḷavikā. There was evidently a large community of monks at Āḷavī, some of whom seem to have chiefly occupied themselves with building vihāras for themselves.</p>

Gotama quickly mastered his doctrine and was able to repeat it by heart; but feeling sure that Āḷāra not only knew the doctrine but had realised it, he approached him and questioned him about it. Āḷāra then proclaimed the Ākiñcaññāyatana, and Gotama, putting forth energy and concentration greater than Āḷāra’s, made himself master of that state. Āḷāra recognised his pupil’s eminence and treated him as an equal, but Gotama, not having succeeded in his quest, took leave of Āḷāra to go elsewhere. When, after having practised austerities for six years, the Buddha attained Enlightenment and granted Sahampati’s request to preach the doctrine, it was of Āḷāra he thought first as being the fittest to hear the teaching. But Āḷāra had died seven days earlier. <span class="ref">Vin.i.7</span></p><p>The Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta <span class="ref">DN.ii.130</span> mentions a Mallian, Pukkusa, who says he had been Āḷāra’s disciple, but who, when he hears the Buddha’s sermon, confesses faith in the Buddha.

She, too, hoping to get some benefit, listened quietly and with great earnestness, hushing her children to quietness. The Buddha preached in such a manner that both she and her son could understand, and at the end of the sermon they both became Sotāpannā. She immediately got rid of her sad Yakkha-state and obtained heavenly bliss, and took up her residence in a tree near the Buddha’s Fragrant Chamber. Little Uttarā was too young to realise the Truth. <span class="ref">SN.i.210</span></p>

<p>A monk, belonging to the Sākyan clan, who was known for his greed in procuring requisites. Several incidents connected with him are mentioned in the Vinaya. Once he promised to spend the rainy season with Pasenadi Kosala, but on his way there he saw two lodgings where robes were plentiful and so kept Vassa in those lodgings instead. Pasenadi was greatly annoyed and when, in due course, the matter reached the ears of the Buddha, Upananda was rebuked and a set of rules was passed regarding promises made about the rainy season. <span class="ref">Vin.i.153</span> On another occasion Upananda spent the rainy season at Sāvatthī, but when the time came for the monks to gather together and divide the robes that had been given to them, he went from village to village, taking his share of the robes from everywhere. The Buddha sent for him and rebuked him in the presence of the Order, but the rebuke had evidently no effect, for we find him again spending the Vassa alone in two residences, with the idea of obtaining many robes. The Buddha, however, ordered that only one portion should be given to him. <span class="ref">Vin.i.300</span> His greediness was not confined to robes. Once he was invited to a meal by an official, a follower of the Ājīvakas. He went late, and finding no room left for him, made a junior monk get up and give him his seat. There was a great uproar, but Upananda had his way. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.165</span> Elsewhere he is accused of having appropriated two lodgings for himself at the same time, one at Sāvatthī and the other somewhere in the country. He was evidently unpopular among the monks, because on this occasion we find him spoken of as “a maker of strife, quarrelsome, a maker of disputes, given to idle talk, a raiser of legal questions.”. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.168</span> Upananda was fond of money, for we find in the Vinaya <span class="ref">Vin.ii.297</span> a statement to the effect that “on the occasion of the matter of Upananda the Sākyan, the Buddha distinctly laid down a precept by which gold and silver were forbidden.” Upananda had been given his meals regularly by a certain</p><p>family. Once a dish of meat was prepared for him, but a little boy in the house started to cry for the meat, and it was given to him. Upananda insisted that a kahāpaṇa should be paid to him in lieu of the meat. <span class="ref">Vin.iii.236<em>f.</em></span> Upananda was once asked to preach to those that came to Jetavana. Among the visitors was a banker, and when the banker expressed the desire to give something to Upananda to show his appreciation of the sermon, Upananda wished to have the robe that the man wore. The banker was embarrassed, and promised to go home at once and fetch him another robe, even better than the one he had on. But Upananda was adamant, till, in despair, the man gave him his robe and went away. Again, when Upananda heard that a certain man wished to offer him a robe, he went to the man and told him what kind of robe he wanted, and said he would accept no other. <span class="ref">Vin.iii.215</span> A story is also told of a Paribbājaka exchanging his own garment for one belonging to Upananda, which was of rich colour. Two other Paribbājakas told him that he had lost in the bargain, so he wished to cry off the deal, but Upananda positively refused. <span class="ref">Vin.iii.240<em>f.</em></span> He did not, however, always come off best in a bargain. Once he gave a robe to a colleague, on condition that the latter should join him in his tours. The condition was agreed to, but later, when the recipient monk heard that the Buddha was going on tour, he preferred to join the Buddha’s company. The robe was not returned to Upananda, who had to be reported to the Buddha for the violent language he used to the defaulter. <span class="ref">Vin.iii.254<em>f.</em></span> Upananda is mentioned as quarrelling with the Chabbaggiyā monks <span class="ref">Vin.iv.30</span> and, at another time, as going his alms-rounds with a colleague with whom he quarrelled when the rounds were over, refusing to give him any of the food obtained. The unfortunate monk had to starve because it was then too late to go out begging again. <span class="ref">Vin.iv.92<em>f.</em></span> We are not told whether Upananda deliberately set out to have a quarrel in order that he might keep all the food himself!</p><p>Nor were all Upananda’s misdemeanours confined to greed for possessions. We are told that once a complaint was made to the Buddha that Upananda had gone to the house of an acquaintance and had sat down in the bedroom of the woman of the house, talking to her. The husband ordered food to be brought to Upananda, and when that was done, asked him to leave. But the woman wished him to stay and he refused to go away. <span class="ref">Vin.iv.94</span></p><p>On two other occasions he is mentioned as visiting the houses of his acquaintances and being found by the husbands, seated alone with their wives. <span class="ref">Vin.iv.95–97</span></p><p>With most laymen, however, be was evidently popular. Mention is made of a meal where the donor kept all the other monks waiting for quite a long while, till Upananda should arrive, after his visits to various households. <span class="ref">Vin.iv.98</span> And, again, of food being sent to the monastery with express instructions that the other monks should eat only after Upananda had done so. <span class="ref">Vin.iv.99</span></p><p>Upananda had under him two novices, Kaṇḍaka and Mahaka, who seem to have resembled their teacher in being undesirables. They were found guilty of having sex together, and the Buddha laid down a rule forbidding a monk from having two novices as students. <span class="ref">Vin.i.79</span> This rule seems to have been rescinded later. <span class="ref">Vin.i.83</span></p>

When Anuruddha and his cousins left the world and sought ordination from the Buddha at Anupiya Grove, Upāli accompanied them.</p><p>At the request of the Sākiyan youths, the Buddha ordained Upāli before them all, so that their pride might be humbled. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.182</span></p><p>Upāli’s <i>upajjhāya</i> was Kappitaka. <span class="ref">Vin.iv.308</span></p><p>In the assembly of the Saṅgha, the Buddha declared him to be the most proficient of those who were learned in the Vinaya <span class="ref">AN.i.24</span> <span class="ref">Vin.iv.142</span> In the First Council, Upāli took a leading part, deciding all the questions relative to the Vinaya, in the same way as Ānanda decided questions regarding the Dhamma. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.286<em>f.</em></span></p><p>In accordance with this tradition, ascribing to Upāli especial authority regarding the rules of the Order, various instances are given of Upāli questioning the Buddha about the Vinaya regulations. Thus we find him consulting the Buddha as to the legality or otherwise of a complete congregation performing, in the absence of an accused monk, an act at which his presence is required. <span class="ref">Vin.i.325<em>f.</em></span> Again, he wishes to know if, in a matter which has caused altercations and schisms among members of the Order, the Saṅgha declares re-establishment of concord without thorough investigation, could such a declaration be lawful?. <span class="ref">Vin.i.358<em>f.</em></span> When a monk intends to take upon himself the conduct of any matter that has to be decided, under what conditions should he do so?

There is a record of another sermon <span class="ref">AN.v.201<em>ff.</em></span> which the Buddha is stated to have preached when Upāli expressed the desire to retire into the solitude of the forest.

At the end of his discussion with the Buddha, which is recorded in the Upāli Sutta, Upāli is converted and invites the Buddha to a meal. Although the Buddha enjoins upon Upāli that his benefactions to the Nigaṇṭhas should not cease because of his conversion, Upāli gives instructions that no Nigaṇṭha be admitted to his presence, but that if they need food it shall be given to them. Hearing a rumour of his conversion, first Tapassī, and later Nāṭaputta himself, go to Upāli’s house, where they learn the truth.

Further down the river lived his brothers Nadī-Kassapa with three hundred disciples and Gayā-Kassapa with two hundred.</p><p>The Buddha visited Uruvelā-Kassapa and took lodging for the night where the sacred fire was kept, in spite of Kassapa’s warning that the spot was inhabited by a fierce Nāga. The Buddha, by his magical powers, overcame, first this Nāga and then another, both of whom vomited fire and smoke. Kassapa being pleased with this exhibition of <i>iddhi</i>-power, undertook to provide the Buddha with his daily food. Meanwhile the Buddha stayed in a grove near by, waiting for the time when Kassapa should be ready for conversion. Here he was visited by the Four Regent Gods, Sakka, Brahma and others. The Buddha spent the whole rainy season there, performing, in all, three thousand five hundred miracles of various kinds, reading the thoughts of Kassapa, splitting firewood for the ascetics’ sacrifices, heating stoves for them to use after bathing in the cold weather, etc. Still Kassapa pesagested in the thought, “The great ascetic is of great magic power, but he is not an arahant like me.” Finally the Buddha decided to startle him by declaring that he was not an arahant, neither did the way he followed lead to arahantship. Thereupon Kassapa owned defeat and reverently asked for ordination. The Buddha asked him to consult with his pupils, and they cut off their hair and threw it with their sacrificial utensils into the river and were all ordained. Nadī-Kassapa and Gayā-Kassapa came to inquire what had happened, and they, too, were ordained with their pupils. At Gayāsīsa the Buddha preached to them the Fire Sermon, and they all attained arahantship.</p><p>From Gayāsīsa the Buddha went to Rājagaha with the Kassapas and their pupils, and in the presence of Bimbisāra and the assembled populace Uruvelā-Kassapa declared his allegiance to the Buddha. <span class="ref">Vin.i.24<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>Later, in the assembly of monks, Uruvelā-Kassapa was declared to be the chief of those who had large followings. <span class="ref">AN.i.25</span> Six verses attributed to him are found in the Theragāthā, <span class="ref">Thag.375–380</span> wherein he reviews his achievement and relates how he was won over by the Buddha.</p>

</div><p>A city near the Himalaya, capital of the Sākiyan republic. The administration and judicial business of the city and all other matters of importance were discussed and decided in the Santhāgārasālā. <span class="ref">DN.i.91</span> The Buddha and his company lived in the Nigrodhārāma or the Mahāvana. When the Buddha returned a few years after his enlightenment, he met many of his family, and several of them ordained, including Nanda and Rāhula. <span class="ref">Vin.i.82</span> <span class="ref">Vin.ii.180</span> </p><p>The Buddha certainly paid other visits besides these to Kapilavatthu. Various Sākyans went to see him both at the Nigrodhārāma and at the Mahāvana, among them being Mahānāma, <span class="ref">SN.v.369<em>f.</em></span> <span class="ref">AN.iii.284<em>f.</em></span> <span class="ref">AN.iv.220<em>f.</em></span> <span class="ref">AN.v.320<em>f.</em></span> Nandiya, <span class="ref">SN.v.403<em>f.</em></span> <span class="ref">SN.v.397<em>f.</em></span> <span class="ref">AN.v.334<em>f.</em></span> Vappa, <span class="ref">AN.ii.196</span> <span class="ref">MN.i.91</span> and perhaps Sārakāni. <span class="ref">SN.v.372</span></p><p>During one visit the Buddha was entrusted with the consecration of a new mote-hall, built by the Sākyans; he preached far into the night in the new building, and, when weary, asked Moggallāna to carry on while he slept. On this occasion was preached the Sekha Sutta. <span class="ref">MN.i.353<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>The books record a visit paid by the Brahmā Sahampati to the Buddha in the Mahāvana at Kapilavatthu. The Buddha, worried by the noisy behavior of some monks who had recently been admitted into the Order, was wondering how he could impress on them the nature of their calling. Sahampati visited him and, being thus encouraged, the Buddha returned to Nigrodhārāma and there performed a miracle before the monks; seeing them impressed, he talked to them on the holy life. <span class="ref">SN.iii.91<em>f.</em></span> <span class="ref">Ud.25</span></p><p>A curious incident is related in connection with a visit paid by the Buddha to Kapilavatthu, when he went there after his rounds among the Kosalans. Mahānāma was asked to find a place of lodging for the night; he searched all through the town without success, and at length the Buddha was compelled to spend the night in the hermitage of Bharaṇḍu, the Kālāman. <span class="ref">AN.i.276<em>f.</em></span> On another occasion we hear of the Buddha convalescing at Kapilavatthu after an illness. <span class="ref">AN.i.219</span></p><p>Not all the Sākyans of Kapilavatthu believed in their kinsman’s great powers. We find, for instance, Daṇḍapāṇi meeting the Buddha in the Mahāvana and, leaning on his staff, questioning him as to his tenets and his gospel. We are told that in answer to the Buddha’s explanations, Daṇḍapāṇi shook his head, waggled his tongue, and went away, still leaning on his staff, his brow puckered into three wrinkles. This was the occasion for the preaching of the Madhupiṇḍika Sutta. <span class="ref">MN.i.108<em>f.</em></span></p><p>Others were more convinced and patronised the Order—​​e.g., Kāla-Khemaka and Ghaṭāya, who built cells for monks in the Nigrodhārāma, as a result of noticing which the Buddha preached the Mahāsuññata Sutta. <span class="ref">MN.iii.109</span></p><p>Mahānāma was the Buddha’s most frequent visitor; to him was preached the Cūḷadukkhakkhandha Sutta. <span class="ref">MN.i.91<em>f.</em></span></p><p>The Dakkhiṇā-vibhaṅga Sutta was preached as the result of a visit to the Buddha by Mahā-Pajāpatī-Gotamī. Apart from those already mentioned, another Sākyan lady lived in Kapilavatthu, Kāḷigodhā by name, and she was the only kinsman, with the exception of the Buddha’s father and wife, to be specially visited by the Buddha. <span class="ref">SN.v.396</span></p><p>The inhabitants of Kapilavatthu are called Kāpilavatthavā. <span class="ref">SN.iv.182</span></p><p>From Kapilavatthu lay a direct road to Vesālī, <span class="ref">Vin.ii.253</span> and through Kapilavatthu passed the road taken by Bāvarī’s disciples from Alaka to Sāvatthī. <span class="ref">Snp.p.194</span></p><p>It was not mentioned by Ānanda among the great cities, in one of which, in his opinion, the Buddha could more fittingly have died than in Kusinārā. <span class="ref">DN.ii.146</span> After the Buddha’s death, a portion of the relics was claimed by the Sākyans of Kapilavatthu, and a shrine to hold them was erected in the city. <span class="ref">DN.ii.167</span></p>

The brahmin, seeing the Buddha begging for alms, suggests that the Buddha should work for his living—​​plough and sow just as he does. The Buddha answers that he, too, is a farmer, and explains his meaning to the bewildered brahmin, who, greatly pleased, offers him a large bowl filled with milk-rice. The Buddha refuses the gift on the plea that Buddhas never accept wages for their sermons. At the Buddha’s own suggestion the food is cast into the river because no one is capable of digesting food once offered to a Tathāgata.

When Pajjota discovered that Jīvaka had fled, after administering to him some medicine containing ghee, he sent Kāka to overtake Jīvaka and bring him back, giving Kāka strict injunctions not to eat anything offered by Jīvaka.</p><p>Kāka came upon the physician at Kosambī having his breakfast. Jīvaka invited him to eat, but he refused. In the end, however, he consented to eat half a myrobalan, which he thought would be harmless, but into which Jīvaka had introduced some drug hidden in his finger nail. Kāka purged violently and was very alarmed. Jīvaka told him that all he desired was for him to be slightly delayed and left him, after having handed over to him the elephant Bhaddavatikā, which he had used in his flight. <span class="ref">Vin.i.277<em>f.</em></span></p>

</div><p>One of the sixteen Great Nations, <span class="ref">AN.i.213</span> its capital being Bārāṇasī.</p><p>At the time of the Buddha, it had been absorbed into the kingdom of Kosala, and Pasenadi was king of both countries.<span class="ref">DN.i.288</span> <span class="ref">MN.ii.111</span> The Vinaya, <span class="ref">Vin.i.28l</span> however, mentions a Kāsika-rājā who sent a robe to Jīvaka. Even at this time, however, the memory of Kāsi as an independent kingdom seems to have been still fresh in men’s minds. It is very frequently mentioned as such in the Jātakas and elsewhere. Kāsi was once ruled by the Bhāratas, one of whom, Dhataraṭṭha, was its king in the time of Reṇu. <span class="ref">DN.ii.235<em>f.</em></span> There seem to have been frequent wars between the countries of Kāsi and Kosala, victory belonging now to one, now to the other.

Among other kings of Kāsi mentioned is Kikī . <span class="ref">MN.ii.49</span></p><p>Kāsi was evidently a great centre of trade and a most populous and prosperous country. Frequent mention is made of caravans leaving Kāsi to travel for trade. One highway went through Kāsi to Rājagaha <span class="ref">Vin.i.212</span> and another to Sāvatthī. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.10</span> Kāsi was famed for her silks, and Kāsi-robes were most highly esteemed as gifts.

Kāsi and Kosala are frequently mentioned together. <span class="ref">AN.v.59</span>. Kāsigāma or Kāsinigama was probably the actual name of the village in Kāsi which was given by Mahākosala to his daughter when she married Bimbisāra. The village produced a revenue of one hundred thousand, and was given to the queen for her bath and perfume money. After Bimbisāra’s death, Pasenadi withdrew the gift from Ajātasattu, which act was the cause of a war between the two. Later, when Pasenadi’s daughter Vajirā was married to Ajātasattu, the village was given back as part of her dowry. <span class="ref">SN.i.82<em>ff.</em></span></p>

At that time it was a small city, “a branch-township with wattle-and-daub houses in the midst of the jungle,” and Ānanda was, at first, disappointed that the Buddha should have chosen it for his Parinibbāna. But the Buddha pointed out to him that in ancient times it had been Kusāvatī, the royal city of Mahā-Sudassana. <span class="ref">DN.ii.146<em>ff.</em></span> It was twelve leagues in length and twelve in breadth, prosperous and full of people, like Āḷakamandā.

Thus, once he went there from Āpaṇa and having spent some time at Kusinārā, proceeded to Ātumā. The Mallas of Kusinārā were always great admirers of the Buddha, even though not all of them were his followers, and on the occasion of this visit they decided that any inhabitant of Kusinārā who failed to go and meet the Buddha and escort him to the city, would be fined five hundred.

</div><p>The capital of the Vatsas or Vaṃsas. In the time of the Buddha its king was Parantapa, and after him reigned his son Udena. Kosambī was evidently a city of great importance at the time of the Buddha for we find Ānanda mentioning it as one of the places suitable for the Buddha’s Parinibbāna.<span class="ref">DN.ii.146</span> <span class="ref">DN.ii.169</span> It was also the most important halt for traffic coming to Kosala and Māgadha from the south and the west. <span class="ref">Vin.i.277</span></p><p>The usual route from Rājagaha to Kosambī was up the river. This was the route taken by Ānanda when he went with five hundred others to inflict the higher punishment on Channa, <span class="ref">Vin.ii.290</span> though there seems to have been a land route passing through Anupiya and Kosambī to Rājagaha. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.184<em>f.</em></span> In the Sutta Nipāta <span class="ref">Snp.1010–1013</span> the whole route is given from Mahissati to Rājagaha, passing through Kosambī, the halting-places mentioned being Ujjeni, Gonaddha, Vedisa, Vanasavhya, Kosambī, Sāketa, Sāvatthī, Setavyā, Kapilavatthu, Kusinārā, Pāvā, Bhoganagara and Vesāli.</p><p>Near Kosambī, by the river, was Udena’s park, the Udakavana, where Ānanda and Piṇḍola-Bhāradvāja preached to the women of Udena’s palace on two different occasions. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.290<em>f.</em></span> The Buddha is mentioned as having once stayed in the Siṃsapāvana in Kosambī. <span class="ref">SN.v.437</span></p><p>Already in the Buddha’s time there were four establishments of the Order in Kosambī—​​the Kukkuṭārāma, the Ghositārāma, the Pāvārika-ambavana, and the Badarikārāma. The Buddha visited Kosambī on several occasions, stopping at one or other of these residences, and several discourses delivered during these visits are recorded in the books.</p><p>A great division once arose among the monks in Kosambī. Some monks charged one of their colleagues with having committed an offence, but he refused to acknowledge the charge and, being himself learned in the Vinaya, argued his case and pleaded that the charge be dismissed. The rules were complicated; on the one hand, the monk had broken a rule and was treated as an offender, but on the other, he should not have been so treated if he could not see that he had done wrong. The monk was eventually excommunicated, and this brought about a great dissension. When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he admonished the partisans of both sides and urged them to give up their differences, but they paid no heed, and even blows were exchanged. The people of Kosambī, becoming angry at the monks’ behaviour, the quarrel grew apace. The Buddha once more counselled concord, relating to the monks the story of King Dīghiti of Kosala, but his efforts at reconciliation were of no avail, one of the monks actually asking him to leave them to settle their differences without his interference. In disgust the Buddha left Kosambī and, journeying through Bālakaloṇakāragāma and the Pācīnavaṃsadāya, retired alone to keep retreat in the Pārileyyaka forest. In the meantime the monks of both parties repented, partly owing to the pressure exerted by their lay followers in Kosambī, and, coming to the Buddha at Sāvatthī, they asked his pardon and settled their dispute. <span class="ref">Vin.i.337–3​57</span> The story of the Buddha going into the forest is given in the Udāna <span class="ref">Ud.iv.5</span> and in the Saṃyutta, <span class="ref">SN.iii.94</span> but the reason given in these texts is that he found Kosambī uncomfortable owing to the vast number of monks, lay people and heretics.</p><p>During the time of the Vajjian heresy, when the Vajjian monks of Vesāli wished to excommunicate Yasa Kākandakaputta, he went by air to Kosambī, and from there sent messengers to the orthodox monks in the different centres. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.298</span></p><p>It was at Kosambī that the Buddha promulgated a rule forbidding the use of intoxicants by monks. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.307</span></p><p>Kosambī is mentioned in the Saṃyutta Nikāya <span class="ref">SN.iv.179</span> as being on the Ganges, but here as elsewhere this simply means on a great river, in this case the Yamuna.</p>

</div><p>The capital of Kāsi-janapada. It was one of the four places of pilgrimage for the Buddhists - the others being Kapilavatthu, Buddhagayā and Kusināra - because it was at, the Migadāya in Isipatana near Bārānasī that the Buddha preached his first sermon to the Pañcavaggiyā <span class="ref">D.ii.141</span>. This was the spot at which all Buddhas set in motion the Wheel of the Law (Dhamma-cakka). It is the custom of Buddhas to travel by air from the Bodhi-tree to the scene of their first sermon, a distance of eighteen leagues <span class="ref">MA.i.388</span>; <span class="ref">Bu.A.242</span>, etc., but the present Buddha did all the journey on foot in order to be able to meet on the way the Ajīvaka Upaka.</p><p>Benares was an important centre of trade and industry. There was direct trade between there and Sāvatthi (DhA.iii.429), the road passing through Bhaddiya <span class="ref">Vin.i.189</span>, and between there and Takkasilā <span class="ref">DhA.i.123</span>. It was the custom for enthusiastic young men of Benares to go to the university at Takkasilā <span class="ref">E.g., J.ii.4</span>; <span class="ref">DhA.i.250</span>, but there seem to have been educational institutions at Benares also, some of which were older than even those of Takkasilā (<span class="ref">KhA.198</span>; see also <span class="ref">DhA.iii.445</span>, where Susīma, Sankha's son, goes from Takkasilā to Benares for purposes of study).</p><p>From Verañjā to Benares there seem to have been two routes: one rather circuitous, passing through Soreyya, and the other direct, crossing the Ganges at Payāgatittha. From Benares the road continued to Vesāli <span class="ref">Sp.i.201</span>. On the road from Benares to Rājagaha was Andhakavinda <span class="ref">Vin.i.220</span>. There seems to have been friendly intercourse between the chieftains of Benares and the kings of Magadha, as shown by the fact that Bimbisāra sent his own physician, Jīvaka, to attend to the son of the Treasurer of Benares <span class="ref">Vin.i.275</span>. The distance from Kosambī to Benares was thirty leagues by river <span class="ref">MA.ii.929</span>.</p><p>The extent of the city of Benares, including its suburbs, at the time when it was the capital of an independent kingdom, is often stated E.g., <span class="ref">J.iv.377</span>; <span class="ref">J.vi.160</span>; <span class="ref">MA.ii.608</span> to have been twelve leagues. The names of several kings are mentioned in the Jātakas, among them being those of Anga, Uggasena, Udaya, Kikī, Dhanañjaya, Mahāsīlava, Vissasena, and Samyama. (The SNA. on the Khaggavisāna Sutta contains the names of several kings of Benares who renounced the world and became Pacceka Buddhas).</p><p>The name which occurs most frequently, however, is that of Brahmadatta, which seems to have been the dynastic name of the Benares kings. In the Mahāgovinda Sutta, the foundation of Bārānasī is attributed to Mahāgovinda, its first king being Dhatarattha, contemporary of Renu <span class="ref">D.ii.235</span>. The Ceylon Chronicles <span class="ref">MT. 127,129,130</span> mention the names of others who reigned in Benares - e.g., Duppasaha and sixty of his descendants; Asoka, son of Samankara, and eighty four thousand of his descendants; also sixteen kings, ancestors of Okkāka. The city itself had been known by different names at different periods; thus, in the time of the Udaya Jātaka it was called Surundhana; in that of the Sutasoma, Sudassana; in that of the Sonananda, Brahmavaddhana; in that of the Khandahāla, Pupphavatī; in that of the Yuvañjaya, Rammanagara <span class="ref">J.iv.119f</span>; and in that of the Sankha, Molinī <span class="ref">J.iv.15</span>. It was also called Kāsinagara and Kāsipura E.g., <span class="ref">J.v.54</span>; <span class="ref">J.vi.165</span>; <span class="ref">DhA.i.87</span>, being the capital of Kāsi. The Bhojājāniya Jātaka <span class="ref">J.i.178</span> says that "all the kings around coveted the kingdom of Benares." In the Brahāchatta Jātaka <span class="ref">J.iii.116</span>, the king of Benares is mentioned as having captured the whole of Kosala. At the time of the Buddha, however, Benares had lost its great political importance. Kosala was already the paramount power in India, and several successful invasions of Kāsi by the Kosalans under their kings Vanka, Dabbasena and Kamsa, are referred to. The final conquest would seem to be ascribed to Kamsa because the epithet Bārānasīggha (conqueror of Benares) is an established addition to his name <span class="ref">J.ii.403</span>.</p><p>Later, when Ajātasattu succeeded in establishing his sway over Kos.</p>

<p>In the time of Kassapa Buddha he was a potter of Vehaliṅga, looking after his blind parents. He was a very pious and devoted follower of the Buddha, ministering to him better than anyone else, and the Buddha accepted his invitation in preference to that of the king of Benares. It is said that when the Buddha was in need of anything he would go to Ghaṭīkāra’s house and take it, whether he were at home or not, so great was his confidence in Ghaṭīkāra’s piety. Once, when Ghaṭīkāra was absent, the people, at the Buddha’s suggestion, took away the thatch from his house to roof the hut of Tathāgata. For three months Ghaṭīkāra’s house remained open to the sky, but no rain fell on it, so great was his faith.</p><p>The Bodhisatta, who at the time of Ghaṭīkāra was a young brahmin named Jotipāla, was the friend of Ghaṭīkāra but had no faith in the Buddha, and Ghaṭīkāra, having failed to persuade him to visit the Buddha, in the end took him by force. Jotipāla was converted and joined the Order, but Ghaṭīkāra, as the only support of his parents, could not renounce the world. Kikī, king of Benares, having heard of his virtues from Kassapa Buddha, sent him five hundred cartloads of the choicest rice, etc., but Ghaṭīkāra returned the gifts, saying that he had plenty for himself. <span class="ref">MN.ii.46<em>ff.</em></span> <span class="ref">SN.i.35<em>f.</em></span></p><p>According to the Saṃyutta Nikāya, <span class="ref">SN.i.35<em>f.</em></span> Ghaṭīkāra visited the Buddha some time after the Enlightenment and the Buddha reminded him of their former friendship. Ghaṭīkāra, on that occasion, speaks of several others who had been his friends in Vehaliṅga—​​Upaka, Phalaganda, Pukkusāti, Bhaddiya, Khaṇḍadeva, Bāhuraggi and Piṅgiya. They had listened to the Buddha’s teaching and, after death, were born in the Avihā-world, where he himself was. In this context the Buddha addresses him as Bhaggava.</p>

This the Cakkaratana does, carrying with it through the air the Cakkavatti with his fourfold army. Wherever the Cakkaratana halts, all the chiefs of that quarter acclaim the Cakkavatti as their overlord and declare their allegiance to him.

<dd>
<p>A World ruler. The world itself means “Turner of the Wheel,” the Wheel (<i>Cakka</i>) being the well known Indian symbol of empire. More than one thousand sons are his; his dominions extend throughout the earth to its ocean bounds; and is established not by the scourge, nor by the sword, but by righteousness. Particulars are found chiefly in the Mahāsudassana, Mahāpadāna, Cakkavattisīhanāda, Bālapaṇḍita and Ambaṭṭha Suttas. <span class="ref">SN.v.98</span></p><p>From the Mahāpadāna Sutta it would appear that the birth of a Cakkavatti is attended by the same miracles as that of the birth of a Buddha.</p><p>Of the Seven Treasures of a Cakkavatti, the Cakkaratana is the chief. After the Wheel, other Treasures make their appearance: first the Elephant, Hatthiratana; it is either the youngest of the Chaddantā-kula or the oldest of the Uposatha-kula. Next the Horse, Assaratana, named Valāhaka, all white with crow black head, and dark mane, able to fly through the air. Then the Veḷuriya-gem from Vepullapabbata, with eight facets, the finest of its species, shedding light for a league around. This is followed by the Woman, belonging either to the royal family of Madda or of Uttarakuru, desirable in every way, both because of her physical beauty and her virtuous character. Then the Treasurer possessed of marvellous vision, enabling him to discover treasures, and then the Adviser, who is generally the Cakkavatti’s eldest son. <span class="ref">DN.ii.174<em>f.</em></span></p><p>Judging from the story of Mahāsudassana, who is the typical Cakkavatti, the World emperor has also four other gifts: a marvellous figure, a life longer than that of other men, good health, and popularity with all classes of his subjects. The perfume of sandalwood issues from his mouth, while his body is like a lily. When the Cakkavatti is about to die the Wheel slips down from its place and sinks down slightly. When the king sees this he leaves the household life, and retires into homelessness, to taste the joys of contemplation, having handed over the kingdom to his eldest son.</p><p>A Cakkavatti is as worthy of a thūpa as a Buddha. <span class="ref">DN.ii.143</span></p>

Jīvaka, therefore, decided to administer it disguised in an astringent decoction, and obtained the king’s permission to use any of the royal animals or to leave the city at any time he wished, on the plea that he must go in search of various medicines. When all preparations were complete, Jīvaka gave the king the medicine and escaped on Bhaddavatikā, the king’s she-elephant, before the truth was discovered. The king sent Kāka in pursuit, but Jīvaka gave Kāka a purgative and so delayed his return until the medicine had taken effect on the king.

<p>A monk. He once stayed at Gijjhakūṭa, dangerously ill and suffering much pain. He was visited by Sāriputta and Mahā Cunda, and when they discovered that he contemplated suicide, they tried to deter him, promising to provide him with all necessaries and to wait on him themselves. Finding him quite determined, Sāriputta discussed with him the Buddha’s teachings and then left him. Soon afterwards Channa committed suicide by cutting his throat. When this was reported to the Buddha, he explained that no blame was attached to Channa, for he was an arahant at the moment of death. <span class="ref">MN.iii.263<em>ff.</em></span> <span class="ref">SN.iv.55<em>ff.</em></span></p>

<p>A monk of the Sakiyan clan whose Theragāthā verse speaks of how he became a monk after being inspired by the teaching of the Buddha.</p><p>Once, when in the Ghositārāma in Kosambī, Channa committed a fault but was not willing to acknowledge it. When the matter was reported to the Buddha, he decreed that the <i>ukkhepaniya-kamma</i> be carried out against him, forbidding him to eat or dwell with the Saṅgha. He therefore changed his residence, but was everywhere “boycotted,” and returned to Kosambī subdued and asking for reprieve, which was granted to him. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.23<em>ff.</em></span> His obstinacy and perverseness are again mentioned elsewhere. <span class="ref">Vin.iv.35</span> <span class="ref">Vin.iv.113</span> <span class="ref">Vin.iv.141</span> A patron of his once erected a <i>vihāra</i> for him, but he so thatched and decked it that it fell down.

This was the last disciplinary act of the Buddha, and the carrying out thereof was entrusted to Ānanda. <span class="ref">DN.ii.154</span> When Ānanda visited Channa at the Ghositārāma and pronounced on him the penalty, even his proud and independent spirit was tamed; he became humble, his eyes were opened, and dwelling apart, earnest and zealous, he became one of the arahants, upon which the penalty automatically lapsed. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.292</span></p>

This boldness on the part of an inferior caused Jotipāla to realise his extreme earnestness and he agreed to go. After hearing the Buddha preach, Jotipāla became a monk. <span class="ref">MN.ii.46ff.;S.i.34<em>f.</em></span></p>

<p>A brahmin, son of Govinda, chaplain of Disampati. Jotipāla was a friend of Disampati’s son, Reṇu, who had six other nobles as companions. On the death of Govinda, Jotipāla became chaplain to Disampati. He inspired Reṇu’s six companions to wait on Reṇu and make him promise to share the kingdom with them when he should come to the throne. This promise Reṇu kept when he succeeded his father and appointed Jotipāla to carry out the division of the kingdom, which the latter duly did. All the kings wished Jotipāla to be their chaplain, and he instructed them in the art of government, teaching the mantras also to seven eminent brahmins and to seven hundred young graduates. Jotipāla himself came to be known as Mahā Govinda.</p><p>After some time, Jotipāla took leave of the seven kings, his disciples and his wives, and spent the four months of the rainy season in a retired spot outside the city, developing <i>jhāna</i> in order to see Brahmā face to face. At the end of the four months, Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra appeared before him and gave him a boon. Jotipāla asked to be taught the way to reach the Brahma-world, and, having listened to Sanaṅkumāra’s exposition, decided to leave the world. The kings and all the others did their best to make him desist from this course, but finding their efforts of no avail they went with him into the homeless life, where all of them profited thereby.</p><p>Jotipāla was the Buddha in a previous life. <span class="ref">DN.ii.232–251</span> He is twice mentioned in the Aṅguttara Nikāya <span class="ref">AN.iii.372</span> <span class="ref">AN.iv.135</span> in a list of ancient teachers with very large followings.</p>

He performed his duties most diligently and with great intelligence, and his fame spread far and wide. Monks coming from afar, wishing to witness his skill, would deliberately arrive late and ask for lodgings in some place remote from Rājagaha; Dabba would “burst into flame” and walk ahead of them, with his finger burning to light them on the way.</p><p>It once happened that meals were allotted by Dabba to the Mettiya-Bhummajakā at the house of a rich man, who, discovering their identity, gave orders that they were to be fed anyhow. The Mettiya-Bhummajakā were greatly offended, and believing that Dabba had intended to slight them, induced one of their partisans, Mettiyā, to accuse Dabba of having seduced her.

<dt><dfn>Devadatta</dfn></dt>
<dd>
<p>A monk, a close relative of the Buddha, who split the Sangha, and attempted to overthrow the Buddha and have him murdered. In one passage in the Vinaya, <span class="ref">Vin.ii.189</span> Devadatta is spoken of as Godhiputta, the son of Godhi.</p><p>When the Buddha visited Kapilavatthu after the Enlightenment and preached to the Sākiyans, Devadatta was converted together with his friends Ānanda, Bhagu, Kimbila, Bhaddiya, Anuruddha, and their barber, Upāli, and he sought the Buddha at Anupiya and entered the Order. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.182</span> During the rainy season that followed, Devadatta acquired the power of <i>iddhi</i> possible to those who are yet of the world <i>puthujjānika-<i>iddhi</i></i>. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.183</span> Sāriputta is mentioned as having gone about Rājagaha singing Devadatta’s praises. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.189</span> Devadatta was later suspected of evil wishes. <span class="ref">SN.ii.156</span> About eight years before the Buddha’s death, Devadatta, eager for gain and favour and jealous of the Buddha’s fame, attempted to win over Ajātasattu. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.184<em>ff.</em></span> <span class="ref">Vin.iii.171<em>f.</em></span> <span class="ref">Vin.iii.174<em>f.</em></span> <span class="ref">Vin.iv.71</span> <span class="ref">AN.iii.123</span> <span class="ref">AN.iii.402</span> <span class="ref">AN.ii.73</span> <span class="ref">AN.iv.160</span></p><p>He assumed the form of a child having a girdle of snakes, and suddenly appeared on Ajātasattu’s lap, frightening him. He then resumed his own form, and Ajātasattu, much impressed, paid him great honour and, it is said, visited him morning and evening with five hundred chariots and sent him daily five hundred dishes of food.</p><p>Sometime later, Devadatta went to the Buddha and suggested that the leadership of the Order should be handed over to him in view of the Buddha’s approaching old age. The Buddha scorned the suggestion, saying, “Not even to Sāriputta or Moggallāna would I hand over the Order, and would I then to thee, vile one, to be vomited like spittle?” <span class="ref">Vin.ii.188</span> <span class="ref">MN.i.393</span> Devadatta showed great resentment and vowed vengeance. Thereupon, at the Buddha’s suggestion, a proclamation was issued to the Saṅgha that in anything done by Devadatta in the name of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saṅgha, none but Devadatta was to be recognised.</p><p>It was at this time that Devadatta incited Ajātasattu to kill his father, Bimbisāra, while he himself prepared to kill the Buddha. Ajātasattu agreed, and provided Devadatta with royal archers to shoot the Buddha. These were placed on different paths, one on one path, two on another, and so on up to sixteen, and the plan was so laid that not one of them would survive to tell the tale. But when the Buddha approached the first man, he was terrified by the Buddha’s majesty, and his body became stiff. The Buddha spoke kindly to him, and the man, throwing away his weapons, confessed his intended crime. The Buddha thereupon preached to him and, having converted him, sent him back by a different path. The other groups of archers, tired of waiting, gave up the vigil and went away one after the other. The different groups were led to the Buddha by his <i>iddhi</i>-power, and he preached to them and converted them. The first man returned to Devadatta saying that he was unable to kill the Buddha because of his great <i>iddhi</i>-power.</p><p>Devadatta then decided to kill the Buddha himself. One day, when the Buddha was walking on the slopes of Gijjhakūṭa, he hurled down on him a great rock. Two peaks sprang up from the ground, thereby arresting its rushing advance, but a splinter struck the Buddha’s foot, causing the blood to flow. Being in great pain, he was carried to Maddakucchi, and from there to Jīvaka’s Ambavana, where Jīvaka attended him. After this event, the monks wished the Buddha to have a guard, but this he refused, saying that it was impossible for anyone to deprive a Tathāgata of his life.</p><p>Devadatta’s next attempt on the Buddha’s life was to persuade elephant-keepers to let loose a fierce elephant, Nalāgiri (or Dhanapāla), drunk with toddy, on to the road by which the Buddha would pass. The news spread rapidly, and the Buddha was warned, but refused to turn back. As the elephant advanced he pervaded it with love, and thus completely subdued it.</p><p>This outrage made Devadatta very unpopular, and even Ajātasattu was compelled by the force of public opinion to withdraw his patronage from Devadatta, whose gain and honour decreased. Thereupon he decided, with the help of several others, Kokālika, Katamoraka-tissa, Khaṇḍadeviyāputta and Samuddadatta, to bring about a schism in the Order. These five went accordingly to the Buddha and asked for the imposition of five rules on all members of the Saṅgha.</p><ol><li>that monks should dwell all their lives in the forest, </li><li>that they should accept no invitations to meals, but live entirely on alms obtained by begging, </li><li>that they should wear only robes made of discarded rags and accept no robes from the laity, </li><li>that they should dwell at the foot of a tree and not under a roof, </li><li> that they should abstain completely from fish and flesh. </li></ol><p>The Buddha’s reply was that those who felt so inclined could follow these rules—​​except that of sleeping under a tree during the rainy season—​​but he refused to make the rules obligatory. This refusal delighted Devadatta, who went about with his party, declaring that the Buddha was prone to luxury and abundance. He was believed by the foolish, and in spite of the Buddha’s warning against the dire sin of causing schism in the Order, Devadatta informed Āmaṇḍa of his intention of holding an uposatha meeting without the Buddha, and, having persuaded five hundred newly ordained monks from Vesāli to join him, he went out to Gayāsīsa. Three suttas, the two Devadatta, and the Mahāsāropama, were preached after this event.</p><p>The Buddha sent Sāriputta and Moggallāna to Gayāsīsa to bring back the deluded ones. Devadatta, believing that they had come to join him, rejoiced, and, in spite of Kokālika’s warning, welcomed them. That night he preached very late to the monks, and, wishing for rest, asked Sāriputta to address the assembly. Sāriputta and Moggallāna preached to such effect that they persuaded the five hundred monks to return with them. Kokālika kicked Devadatta on the chest to awaken him and tell him the news. When Devadatta discovered what had happened, hot blood came from his mouth, and for nine months he lay grievously ill.</p><p>As his end drew near, he wished to see the Buddha, though the latter had declared that it would not be possible in this life. Devadatta, however, started the journey on a litter, but on reaching Jetavana, he stopped the litter on the banks of the pond and stepped out to wash. The earth opened and he was swallowed up in Avīci.</p><p>Only once is mention made <span class="ref">AN.iv.402<em>f.</em></span> of the text of a sermon by Devadatta. Candikāputta reports this to Sāriputta, who makes it an occasion for a talk to the monks.</p>

The Buddha, seeing this, chided Dhaniya and ordered the hut to be pulled down. Dhaniya then built a hut of wood which he obtained from a guild of timber merchants, suppliers of wood to the king, giving them to understand that he had the king’s permission. Vassakāra, hearing of this, reported the matter to Bimbisāra, who sent for Dhaniya. Dhaniya maintained that the king, by royal proclamation, had permitted the monks to use the royal supplies of wood and other materials. Bimbisāra admitted the proclamation, but said it referred only to supplies straight from the forest, and he sent Dhaniya away with a warning.

<p>An elephant of the royal stalls at Rājagaha. Devadatta, after several vain attempts to kill the Buddha, obtained Ajātasattu’s consent to use Nālagiri as a means of encompassing the Buddha’s death. Nālagiri was a fierce animal, and in order to increase his fierceness, Devadatta instructed his keeper to give him twice his usual amount of toddy. Proclamation was made, by the beating of drums, that the streets of the city should be cleared as Nālāgiri would be let loose upon them. When the Buddha was informed of this and warned against going into the city for alms, he ignored the warning, and went into Rājagaha with the monks of the eighteen monasteries of the city. At the sight of Nālāgiri all the people fled in terror. Ānanda, seeing the elephant advancing towards the Buddha, went, in spite of the Buddha’s orders to the contrary, and stood in front of the Buddha, who had to make use of his supernatural power to remove him from his place. The Buddha spoke to him, suffusing him with all the love at his command, and, stretching out his right hand, he stroked the animal’s forehead. Thrilling with joy at the touch, Nālāgiri sank on his knees before the Buddha. The Buddha returned to Veḷuvana. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.194<em>f.</em></span></p>

<dd>
<p>Founder or reformer of the Jains. One of six eminent teachers, contemporary with the Buddha; he is described as a outsider. <span class="ref">SN.i.66</span></p><p>He was leader of a sect known as the Nigaṇṭhā, and a summary of his teachings is found in the Sāmaññaphala Sutta. <span class="ref">DN.i.57</span></p><p>Nāṭaputta is stated to have claimed omniscience—​​to be all-knowing, all seeing, to have all comprising knowledge and vision. “Whether I walk or stand or sleep or wake,” he is mentioned as saying, “my knowledge and vision are always, and without a break, present before me.” <span class="ref">MN.ii.31</span> <span class="ref">AN.i.220</span> <span class="ref">MN.i.92<em>f.</em></span> <span class="ref">MN.ii.214<em>ff.</em></span> It is curious, in view of this statement of Nāṭaputta’s doctrine of inaction, that the main ground on which he is stated to have objected to Sīha’s visit to the Buddha, was that the Buddha was an akiriyavādī. <span class="ref">AN.iv.180</span></p><p>He taught that past deeds should be extirpated by severe austerities, fresh deeds should be avoided by inaction. By expelling through penance all past misdeeds and by not committing fresh misdeeds, the future became cleared. From the destruction of deeds results the destruction of dukkha; this leads to the destruction of vedanā. Thus all dukkha is exhausted and one passes beyond the round of existence. It is said that Nāṭaputta did not employ the term kamma in his teaching; he used, instead, the word daṇḍa; and that, according to him, the daṇḍa of deed was far more criminal than the dandas of word and mind. <span class="ref">MN.i.371</span></p><p>He is said to have shown no hesitation in declaring the destinies of his disciples after death <span class="ref">SN.iv.398</span> ; but Sakuludāyi says <span class="ref">MN.ii.31</span> <span class="ref">MN.i.93</span> <span class="ref">MN.ii.214<em>f.</em></span> that when asked a question as to the past, he skipped from one matter to another and dismissed the question, evincing irritation, bad temper and resentment.</p><p>Only one discussion is recorded between Nāṭaputta and a follower of the Buddha, and that was with Citta gahapati at Macchika Sanda. <span class="ref">SN.iv.298<em>ff.</em></span> He praises Citta at the outset of the discussion, holding him up as an example to his own flock, and agreeing with Citta that knowledge is more excellent than faith. But later, when Citta claims knowledge of the four <i>jhānas</i>, Nāṭaputta is represented as condemning him for a deceitful man. Citta, thereupon, asks him ten questions and, getting no answer, leaves him.</p><p>The Devadaha Sutta <span class="ref">MN.ii.214</span> <span class="ref">MN.i.91<em>ff.</em></span> <span class="ref">AN.v.150</span> <span class="ref">DN.iii.119</span> contains a detailed analysis and attributed to the Buddha, of the beliefs and teachings of the Nigaṇṭhas. He there selects for his condemnation ten of their operative utterances, major and minor, and proves that the efforts and strivings of the Nigaṇṭhas are fruitless.</p><p>The books contain the names of several disciples of Nāṭaputta, among them a deva called Ninka. <span class="ref">SN.i.66</span> Nāṭaputta is so convinced of the truth and the irrefutableness of his own doctrines, that he actually encourages his disciples to hold discussions with the Buddha. Some, like Dīgha Tapassī, come away unscathed, without having carried the discussion to any conclusion; others are mentioned as being convinced by the Buddha in the end and as becoming his disciples. Such, for instance, are Asibandhakaputta <span class="ref">SN.iv.317<em>ff.</em></span> and Abhayarājakumāra. <span class="ref">MN.i.392<em>ff.</em></span> Nāṭaputta tries, without success, to dissuade Sīha, general of the Licchavis, from visiting the Buddha. <span class="ref">AN.iv.180<em>ff.</em></span> Sīha goes and is converted. The next day he holds an almsgiving, on a grand scale, to the Buddha and his monks, at which flesh is served. It is said that Nāṭaputta went about Vesāli, sneering at the Buddha for encouraging slaughter. <span class="ref">Vin.i.233<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>But the greatest blow to Nāṭaputta was when Upāli-gahapati <span class="ref">MN.i.373<em>ff.</em></span> joined the Buddha. Nāṭaputta had allowed Upāli to visit him in spite of the warning of Dīgha-Tapassī as to the Buddha’s arresting personality. But Nāṭaputta thought Upāli would be proof against it, and, on hearing that he had renounced his allegiance to the Nigaṇṭhas, refused to believe it until he could verify the information himself. The discovery of the apostasy of Upāli prostrated him with grief.; he vomited hot blood and had to be carried away on a litter from Bālaka, where he was then living, to Pāvā. There, soon after, he died, and immediately great dissensions arose among his followers. When the Buddha heard of the quarrels, he remarked that it was only to be expected. <span class="ref">MN.ii.243<em>f.</em></span> <span class="ref">DN.iii.117</span> <span class="ref">DN.iii.210</span></p><p>Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta is the name by which the Jaina teacher, Mahāvīra, was known to his contemporaries.

<p>Head of one of the six heretical sects of the Buddha’s time. In the Sāmaññaphala Sutta, <span class="ref">DN.i.56</span> Ajātasattu is said to have visited him and obtained from him an exposition of his teaching, which was to the effect that the four elements—​​earth, fire, air, water; pleasure, pain, and the soul—​​these seven things were eternally existent and unchangeable in their very nature; that there is no volitional activity of consciousness in them. His doctrine is, therefore, one of non action. When one, with a sharp sword, cleaves a head in twain, no one is thereby deprived of life, a sword has merely penetrated into the interval between seven elementary substances. In other words, there is no such act as killing, or hearing, or knowing, etc.; no conceptions of, or distinction between, good and bad, knowledge and ignorance, etc.</p><p>Pakudha’s teachings are also referred to in the Sandaka Sutta, <span class="ref">MN.i.517</span> and there described at even greater length, but here his name is not mentioned.</p><p>We are told <span class="ref">MN.i.250</span> <span class="ref">MN.ii.4</span> that Pakudha’s followers did not hold him in high esteem, in contrast to the devotion felt for the Buddha by his followers.

<dt><dfn>Paribbājakā</dfn></dt>
<dd>
<p>Wanderer. The name given to some of the ascetics and recluses of the Buddha’s time. They were not exclusively brahmin. Their presence seems to have been recognized and respected from earlier times. Generally speaking, their creed is formulated as a belief in perfect bliss after death for the self purged from evil, and as a conviction that this bliss can be won by brahmacariyā, by freedom from all evil in acts, words, aims, and mode of livelihood. <span class="ref">MN.ii.24</span></p><p>All these four standards of conduct were bodily incorporated in the Buddha’s Noble Eightfold Path, and the last of the four gave to the Ājīvakas their specific name as a separate sect. The Paribbājakas claimed to be identical with the followers of the Buddha in their tenets and teaching, <span class="ref">MN.i.64f</span> <span class="ref">MN.i.84<em>f.</em></span> but the Buddha maintained that the two teachings were quite distinct. This is clearly indicated <span class="ref">Vin.i.39</span> in connection with the conversion of Sāriputta and Moggallāna, who were Paribbājakas under Sañjaya. The goal of the Paribbājakas was deathlessness which, to them, probably meant birth in the world of Brahmā. Their conversion to the Buddha’s Doctrine followed the recognition that Gotama dealt, not with effects but with causes, and that he went to the root of the matter by teaching how casual states of consciousness arose and how they could be banished for ever. <span class="ref">AN.iv.35<em>ff.</em></span> <span class="ref">AN.iv.378</span> <span class="ref">AN.i.215</span></p><p>The Paribbājakas were not ascetics except in so far as they were celibates; some of them were women. They were teachers or sophists who spent eight or nine months of every year wandering from place to place for the purpose of engaging in friendly, conversational discussions on matters of ethics and philosophy, nature lore and mysticism. They differed very much in intelligence, earnestness, and even in honesty. Some of the views discussed in the Brahmajāla Sutta, for instance, and described as those of “Eel wrigglers” and “Hair splitters”, were undoubtedly truly thus described. The books mention halls erected for the accommodation of the Paribbājakas, such as those in Mallikā’s park at Sāvatthī, <span class="ref">DN.i.178</span> and the Kūṭāgārasālā at Vesāli.</p><p>Sometimes special places were set apart for them in the groves near the settlements, as at Campā on the bank of the Gaggarā lake, <span class="ref">DN.i.111</span> at the Moranivāpa in Rājagaha, <span class="ref">AN.v.326</span> and on the banks of the Sappinikā. <span class="ref">AN.i.185</span> <span class="ref">AN.ii.175</span></p><p>It was in such places that the Paribbājakas met each other, and in the course of their journeys they would visit each other in order to exchange greetings of courtesy and to engage in profitable discussion. The utmost cordiality seems to have prevailed on these occasions, intercourse and discussions were free, there were no restrictions of creed, caste or pride. Thus Dīghanakha calls on the Buddha, <span class="ref">MN.i.497</span> the Buddha on Sakuladāyī <span class="ref">MN.ii.29</span> <span class="ref">AN.ii.175<em>ff.</em></span> and Sarabha. <span class="ref">AN.i.185</span> Vekhanassa calls on the Buddha, <span class="ref">MN.ii.40</span> as do Timbaruka, <span class="ref">SN.ii.22</span> Vacchagotta, <span class="ref">SN.iii.257</span> and Sivaka Moliya. <span class="ref">SN.iv.230</span> Potaliputta calls on Samiddhi, <span class="ref">MN.iii.207</span> Susīma on Ānanda, <span class="ref">SN.ii.119</span> and Jambukhādaka on Sāriputta. <span class="ref">SN.iv.251</span></p><p>The inhabitants of the towns and villager, near which the Paribbājakas stopped, visited them, both to show their respect and to benefit by their teachings. The names of a considerable number of Paribbājakas, besides those already mentioned, who were well known in the time of the Buddha, are given in the texts e.g., Annabhāra, Varadhara, etc., <span class="ref">AN.ii.175</span> also Sāmaṇḍaka, <span class="ref">SN.iv.26</span> and the Paribbājikā Sucimukhī. <span class="ref">SN.iii.238<em>f.</em></span> In most cases they are represented as having large followings, so that they were evidently regarded as distinguished teachers.</p>

A message was sent to him asking him to come as the Buddha was at his hermitage, but Pātikaputta was unable to arise from his seat. Thereupon, a Licchavi minister, and, after him, Jāliya Dārupattikantevāsī, went to fetch him, but on discovering that he could not rise, they reviled him for his boastfulness. <span class="ref">AN.iii.13<em>ff.</em></span></p>

Perhaps the <i>sekhiya</i> were not originally recited.</p><p>The Pātimokkha is not included in the extant Buddhist Canon.

Each section of the rules is recited and, at the end of such recital, the reciter asks the members of the Order who are present if any one of them has infringed any of the rules. Silence implies absence of guilt. This practice of interrupting the recital seems to have been changed later <span class="ref">Vin.ii.240<em>ff.</em></span> even though the old formula, asking the members to speak, continued as a part of the recital.</p><p>The word <i>pātimokkha</i> is variously explained, the oldest explanation being that the observance of the rules is the face (<i>mukhaṃ</i>), the chief (<i>pamukhaṃ</i>) of good qualities.</p>

</div><p>The Buddha visited Pātaligāma shortly before his death. Although it later became the capital of Magadha, it was then a mere village. At that time Ajātasattu's ministers, Sunīdha and Vassakāra, were engaged in building fortifications there in order to repel the Vajjīs. The Buddha prophesied the future greatness of Pātaligāma, and also mentioned the danger of its destruction by fire, water, or internal discord. The gate by which the Buddha left the town was called Gotamadvāra, and the ferry at which he crossed the river, Gotamatittha <span class="ref">Vin.i.226 30</span>; <span class="ref">D.ii.86ff</span>.</p><p>The date at which Pātaliputtta became the capital is uncertain. Hiouen Thsang seems to record (Beal: Records ii.85, n. 11) that it was Kālāsoka who moved the seat of government there. The Jains maintain that it was Udāyi, son of Ajātasattu <span class="ref">Vin. Texts ii.102, n. 1</span>. The latter tradition is probably correct as, according to the Anguttara Nikāya <span class="ref">iii.57</span> even Munda is mentioned as residing at Pātaliputta. It was, however, in the time of Asoka that the city enjoyed its greatest glory. In the ninth year of his reign Asoka's income from the four gates of the city is said to have been four hundred thousand kahāpanas daily, with another one hundred thousand for his sabhā or Council <span class="ref">Sp.i.52</span>.</p><p>The city was known to the Greeks as Pālibothra, and Megasthenes, who spent some time there, has left a vivid description of it (Buddhist India 262f). It continued to be the capital during the greater part of the Gupta dynasty, from the fourth to the sixth century A.C. Near Pātaliputta was the Kukkutārāma, where monks (e.g. Ananda, Bhadda and Nārada) stayed when they came to Pātaliputta <span class="ref">M.i.349</span>; <span class="ref">A.v.341</span>; <span class="ref">A.iii.57</span>; <span class="ref">S.v.15f.</span>, <span class="ref">S.v.171f</span>. At the suggestion of Udena Thera, the brahmin Ghotamukha built an assembly hall for the monks in the city <span class="ref">M.ii.163</span>.</p><p>Pātaligāma was so called because on the day of its foundation several pātali shoots sprouted forth from the ground. The officers of Ajātasattu and of the Licchavi princes would come from time to time to Pātaligāma, drive the people from their houses, and occupy them themselves. A large hall was therefore built in the middle of the village, divided into various apartments for the housing of the officers and their retainers when necessary. The Buddha arrived in the village on the day of the completion of the building, and the villagers invited him to occupy it for a night, that it might be blessed by his presence. On the next day they entertained the Buddha and his monks to a meal <span class="ref">Ud.viii.6</span>; <span class="ref">UdA.407ff</span>.</p>

<p>A monk whose enigmatic Theragāthā verse speaks of what has come and not departed. <span class="ref">Thag.9</span> Certain devas who had been born in the deva world as a result of Pilinda’s guidance in a former birth, out of gratitude, waited on him morning and evening. He thus became famous as being dear to the devas, and was declared by the Buddha to be chief among such monks. <span class="ref">AN.i.24</span></p><p>Pilinda had a habit of addressing everyone as outcaste. When this was reported to the Buddha he explained that this was because Pilinda had, for one hundred lives, been born among Vasalavādī-Brahmins. <span class="ref">Ud.iii.6</span></p><p>The Vinaya Pītaka mentions that on several different occasions Pilinda suffered from various ailments and the Buddha had to give permission for the provision of suitable remedies. <span class="ref">Vin.i.204<em>f.</em></span></p><p>Once Bimbisāra found Pilinda, clearing a cave in order to provide a cell for himself. The king promised to build a monastery for him if he could obtain the Buddha’s sanction. The permission was obtained and was reported to the king, but he forgot the matter until one hundred days later. On remembering, he made ample amends, gave Pilinda five hundred attendants to look after the monastery, and granted for their maintenance a village, which came to be called Arāmikagāma or Pilindagāma. One day, while in the village for alms, Pilinda went into a house where a girl was weeping because the day was a feast day and she had no ornament to wear, her parents being too poor to afford any. Pilinda gave her a roll of grass to put round her head and it turned instantly into solid gold. The king’s officers, hearing of this wreath, suspected the family of theft and cast them into prison. The next day Pilinda, discovering what had happened, visited the king and convinced him of his <i>iddhi</i> powers by turning the whole palace into gold. The family was released, and the king and his courtiers gave to Pilinda large quantities of the five medicaments, all of which Pilinda distributed among those who wished for them. <span class="ref">Vin.i.206<em>ff.</em></span> <span class="ref">Vin.iii.248<em>ff.</em></span> This was the occasion for the forming of the rule that all medicaments required by a monk should be used within seven days.</p><p>Another story is related of Pilinda’s <i>iddhi</i> powers. <span class="ref">Vin.iii.67</span> Once a family of Benares, which was wont to minister to Pilinda, was attacked by robbers and two girls were kidnapped. Pilinda, by his <i>iddhi</i> power caused them to be brought back, and the monks complained of this to the Buddha, but the Buddha held that no wrong had been done.</p>

The Buddha told him how, when he himself was in Atumā in the Bhusāgāra, there was a great thunderstorm which killed two peasants and four oxen, but that he had heard and seen nothing, so deep was his concentration. Pukkusa was greatly impressed by this statement, and, having declared himself a follower of the Buddha, he gave to the Buddha two robes of cloth of gold, one of which, at the Buddha’s suggestion, he handed to Ānanda.

The Buddha acted on this suggestion and spent the night there.</p><p>When Mahānāma arrived the next morning, the Buddha talked to him about the three kinds of teachers: those who have full comprehension of sense desires only but not of objects of sense or of feelings; those who have full comprehension of sense desires and of objects of sense; and those who have comprehension of all three. Would their conclusions coincide, or would they differ.</p><p>Here Bharaṇḍu chimed in and asked Mahānāma to say they would be the same.

</div><p>The name of a people and their country.</p><p>The country is included in the sixteen Great Nations of the Buddha’s time. The kingdom, at that time, was divided into two parts, having their respective capitals in Pāvā and Kusinārā. The Mallas of Pāvā were called Pāveyyakā Mallā, those of Kusināra, Kosinārakā. That these were separate kingdoms is shown by the fact that after the Buddha’s death at Kusināra, the Mallas of Pāvā sent messengers to claim their share of the Buddha’s relics. <span class="ref">DN.ii.165</span> Each had their Mote Hall.</p><p>In the Saṅgīti Sutta we are told that the Buddha, in the course of one of his journeys, came with five hundred followers to Pāvā and stayed in the Ambavana of Cunda the smith. A new Mote Hall, called Ubbhataka, had just been completed for the Mallas of Pāvā, and the Buddha was invited to be the first to occupy it that it might be consecrated thereby. The Buddha accepted the invitation, and preached in the Hall far into the night. It was also at Pāvā that the Buddha took his last meal, of Sūkaramaddava, at the house of Cunda. <span class="ref">DN.ii.126<em>f.</em></span> From there he went to Kusinārā, and there, as he lay dying, he sent Ānanda to the Mallas of Kusināra, who were assembled in their Mote Hall to announce his approaching death. The Mallas thereupon came to the Upavattana Sāla grove where the Buddha was, in order to pay him their last respects. Ānanda made them stand in groups according to family, and then presented them to the Buddha, announcing the name of each family. After the Buddha’s death, they met together once more in the Mote Hall, and made arrangements to pay him all the honour due to a Cakkavatti. They cremated the Buddha’s body at the Makuṭabandhana cetiya, and then collected the relics, which they deposited in their Mote Hall, surrounding them with a lattice work of spears and a rampart of bows till they were distributed among the various claimants by Doṇa. <span class="ref">DN.ii.166</span> The Mallas, both of Pāvā and Kusināra, erected thūpas over their respective shares of the relics and held feasts in their honour. <span class="ref">DN.ii.167</span></p><p>The Malla capital of Kusinārā was, in the Buddha’s day, a place of small importance. Ānanda contemptuously refers to it as a “little wattle and daub town in the midst of a jungle, a branch township,” quite unworthy of being the scene of the Buddha’s Parinibbāna. But the Buddha informs Ānanda that it was once Kusāvatī, the mighty capital of Kusa and Mahāsudassana. They were regarded, together with the Vajjis, as a typical example of a republic. <span class="ref">MN.i.231</span> The chief Mallas administered the state in turn.</p><p>Both the Buddha and Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta appear to have had followers among the Mallas. Pāvā was the scene of Nāṭaputta’s death, just as Kusinārā was of the Buddha’s. Several followers of the Buddha among the Mallas are mentioned by name—​​e.g., Dabba, Pukkusa, Khaṇḍasumana, Bhadragaka, Rāsiya, Rojā and Sīha.</p><p>Other places in the Malla country, besides Pāvā and Kusinārā, are mentioned where the Buddha stayed—​​e.g., Bhoganagara, Anupiya and Uruvelakappa, near which was the Mahāvana, a wide tract of forest.</p>

Having learnt the facts, she faces Pasenadi again, and convinced him too that the Buddha is right.</p><p>Mallikā had a garden, called the Mallikārāma, in which was a Hall among the Deispyros trees set apart for religious discussions between members of various sects. <span class="ref">MN.ii.22</span> <span class="ref">DN.i.178</span></p><p>Mallikā is included in a list of eminent <i>upāsikās</i>. <span class="ref">AN.iv.348</span></p>

<dt>Pippali</dt>
<dd>
<p>One of the Buddha’s most eminent disciples, chief among those who upheld austere practices. <span class="ref">AN.i.23</span> His personal name was Pippali, but he is usually known by his clan name Kassapa, prefixed with Mahā to distinguish him from the other Kassapas.</p><p>Mahākassapa went forth, apparently together with his wife Bhaddā Kāpilānī, before meeting the Buddha on the road. He gave him a brief teaching: <span class="ref">SN.ii.220</span> ‘There shall be a lively sense of conscience and regard towards all monks, seniors, novices, and those of middle status.’ ‘Whatever doctrine I shall hear bearing upon what is good, to all that I will hearken with attentive ear, digesting it, pondering it, gathering it all up with my will.’ ‘Happy mindfulness with respect to the body shall not be neglected by me.’</p><p>The Buddha exchanged his worn robes for Kassapa’s, which was regarded as a unique honor. <span class="ref">SN.ii.221</span></p><p>Kassapa was not present at the death of the Buddha; as he was journeying from Pāvā to Kusināra he met an Ājīvaka carrying in his hand a <i>mandārava</i> flower picked up by him from among those which had rained from heaven in honour of the Buddha, and it was he who told Kassapa the news. It was then the seventh day after the Buddha’s death, and the Mallas had been trying in vain to set fire to his pyre. The arahant theras, who were present, declared that it could not be kindled until Mahā Kassapa and his five hundred companions had saluted the Buddha’s feet. Mahā Kassapa then arrived and walked three times round the pyre with bared shoulder, and it is said the Buddha’s feet became visible from out of the pyre in order that he might worship them. He was followed by his five hundred colleagues, and when they had all worshipped the feet disappeared and the pyre kindled of itself. <span class="ref">DN.ii.163<em>f.</em></span></p><p>At Pāvā (on the announcement of the Buddha’s death), Kassapa had heard the words of Subhadda, who, in his old age, had joined the Order, that they were “well rid of the great samaṇa and could now do as they liked.” This remark it was which had suggested to Kassapa’s mind the desirability of holding a Recital of the Buddha’s teachings. The five hundred who were selected met in Council under the presidency of Kassapa and recited the Dhamma and the Vinaya.</p><p>The books contain numerous references to Mahā Kassapa—​​he is classed with Moggallāna, Kappina, and Anuruddha for his great <i>iddhi</i>-powers. <span class="ref">SN.i.114</span></p><p>The Buddha regarded him as equal to himself in exhorting the monks to lead the active and zealous lives, <span class="ref">SN.ii.205</span> and constantly held him up as an example to others in his great contentment <span class="ref">SN.ii.194<em>f.</em></span> and his ability to win over families by his preaching. The Buddha compares him to the moon, unobtrusive; his heart was free from bondage, and he always taught others out of a feeling of compassion. <span class="ref">SN.ii.197<em>ff.</em></span> The Buddha also thought him equal to himself in his power of attaining the <i>jhānas</i> and abiding therein. <span class="ref">SN.ii.210<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>Kassapa was willing to help monks along their way, and several instances are given of his exhortations to them. <span class="ref">Thag.1051–1057</span> <span class="ref">Thag.1072–10​81</span> <span class="ref">AN.v.161<em>ff.</em></span> But he would not address them unless he felt them to be tractable and deferential to instruction. <span class="ref">SN.ii.203<em>ff.</em></span> <span class="ref">SN.ii.219</span></p><p>He was very reluctant to preach to the nuns, but on one occasion he allowed himself to be persuaded by Ānanda, and accompanied by him he visited the nunnery and preached to the nuns. He was probably not popular among certain nuns, for, at the end of his discourse, Thullatissā openly reviled him for what she called his impertinence in having dared to preach in the presence of Ānanda, “as if the needle pedlar were to sell a needle to the needle maker.”. <span class="ref">SN.ii.215<em>f.</em></span> Kassapa was very careful of the good name of the Order, and we find him <span class="ref">SN.ii.218<em>f.</em></span> blaming Ānanda for admitting into the Order new members incapable of observing its discipline and of going about with them in large numbers, exposing the Order to the criticism of the public. “A corn trampler art thou, Ānanda,” he says, “a despoiler of families, thy following is breaking up, thy youngsters are melting away,” and ends up with “The boy, methinks, does not know his own measure.” Ānanda, annoyed at being called “boy,” protests “Surely my head is growing grey hairs, your reverence.” Ānanda regarded Kassapa in some sort of way as a teacher, and held him in great respect, not daring to mention even his name, lest it should imply disrespect. <span class="ref">Vin.i.92<em>f.</em></span></p><p>Thullanandā heard Kassapa censuring Ānanda and raised her voice in protest, “What now? Does Kassapa, once a heretic, deem that he can chide the learned sage Ānanda?” Kassapa was hurt by her words, and complained to Ānanda that such things should be said of him who had been singled out by the Buddha for special honour.</p><p>Kassapa viewed with concern the growing laxity among members of the Order with regard to the observance of rules, even in the very lifetime of the Buddha, and the falling off in the number of those attaining arahantship, and we find him consulting the Buddha as to what should be done. <span class="ref">SN.ii.224<em>f.</em></span> At the First Council, when Ānanda stated that the Buddha had given leave for the monks to do away with the minor rules of the Order, Kassapa was opposed to any such step, lest it should lead to slackness among the monks and contempt from the laity. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.287<em>f.</em></span></p><p>Kassapa himself did his utmost to lead an exemplary life, dwelling in the forest, subsisting solely on alms, wearing rag robes, always content with little, holding himself aloof from society, ever strenuous and energetic. See also the Mahāgosiṅga Sutta, <span class="ref">MN.i.214</span> where Kassapa declares his belief in the need for these observances; that his example was profitable to others is proved by the case of Somamitta who, finding his own teacher Vimala given up to laziness, sought Kassapa and attained arahantship under his guidance.</p><p>When asked why he led such a life, he replied that it was not only for his own happiness but also out of compassion for those who came after him, that they might attain to the same end. Even when he was old and the Buddha himself had asked him to give up his coarse rag robe and to dwell near him, he begged to be excused. <span class="ref">SN.ii.202<em>f.</em></span></p><p>Once, when Kassapa lay grievously ill at Pipphaliguhā, the Buddha visited him and reminded him of the seven bojjhangas which he had practised. <span class="ref">SN.v.78</span></p><p>Kassapa had special compassion for the poor and would sgo to the poorest families to seek alms. <span class="ref">Ud.iii.7</span></p><p> Sāriputta seems to have held Kassapa in great esteem, and the Kassapa Saṃyutta contains two discussions between them: one on the necessity for zeal and ardour in the attainment of Nibbāna, <span class="ref">SN.ii.195<em>f.</em></span> and the other on the existence of a Tathāgata after death. <span class="ref">SN.ii.222<em>f.</em></span> This regard was mutual, for when Kassapa saw the great honour paid to Sāriputta by the devas he rejoiced greatly and broke forth into song. <span class="ref">Thag.1082–1085</span></p>

<p>One of the foremost disciples of the Buddha, ranked foremost among masters of analytical knowledge. <span class="ref">AN.i.24</span> His Theragāthā verse speaks of contentment and shaking off evil qualities. <span class="ref">Thag.2</span></p><p>Several instances are given of discussions between Koṭṭhita and other eminent theras—​​e.g., the Naḷakalāpiya Sutta on <i>kamma</i>, <span class="ref">SN.ii.112<em>f.</em></span> the Sīla Sutta on religious discipline, <span class="ref">SN.iii.165<em>ff.</em></span> three suttas on the nature of arising, two on satisfaction, <span class="ref">SN.iii.172–177</span> two on arising, <span class="ref">SN.iii.173</span> and three on ignorance and knowledge. <span class="ref">SN.iii.17</span> Another similar sutta is on sense and sense objects, <span class="ref">SN.iv.162–16​5</span> and there is a series of suttas on matters not revealed by the Buddha. <span class="ref">SN.iv.384–3​91</span></p><p>All these suttas took the form of discussions with Sāriputta, in which Mahā Koṭṭhita is the questioner and Sāriputta the instructor.</p><p>One sutta <span class="ref">SN.iv.145–147</span> records a “lesson” given by the Buddha to Koṭṭhita on conceptions of impermanence, suffering and not-self.

Another discussion <span class="ref">AN.ii.161<em>f.</em></span> takes place between Sāriputta and Koṭṭhita as to whether anything continues to exist after the ending of the six spheres of contact. Once there was a dispute between Koṭṭhita and Citta Hatthisāriputta; Citta was constantly interrupting the elder monks who were gathered at Isipatana for the discussion of the Abhidhamma, and was asked by Koṭṭhita to abide his time and not interrupt. Citta’s friends protested that Citta was well qualified to take part in the discussion; but Koṭṭhita declared that, far from being wise enough, Citta would, not long after, renounce the Order. And so it happened. <span class="ref">AN.iii.392<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>Sāriputta evidently had a great regard for Koṭṭhita; the Theragāthā <span class="ref">Thag.1006–100​8</span> contains three stanzas in which Sāriputta proclaims his excellence.</p>

On another occasion, Mahānāma visited the Buddha at Nigrodhārāma where the Buddha was convalescing after a severe illness, and at once Mahānāma asked a question as to whether concentration followed or preceded knowledge. Ānanda, who was present, not wishing the Buddha to be troubled, took Mahānāma aside and explained to him the Buddha’s teachings on the subject. <span class="ref">SN.i.219<em>f.</em></span></p><p>See also the Cūḷa Dukkhakkhandha Sutta and Sekha Sutta, both preached to Mahānāma.</p><p>Mahānāma is included in a list of exemplary lay devotees. <span class="ref">AN.iii.451</span></p>

<p>An eminent bhikkhunī and the step-mother of the Buddha. She raised the Buddha as her own child after the death of his mother.</p><p>She is chiefly remembered as the first bhikkhunī. When the Buddha was staying at Kapilavatthu she approached the Buddha with 500 Sakyan ladies and asked leave to be ordained as nuns. The Buddha did not acquiesce, and he went on to Vesāli. But Pajāpatī and her companions cut off their hair, and donning yellow robes, followed the Buddha to Vesāli on foot. They arrived with sore feet at the Buddha’s monastery and repeated their request. The Buddha again refused, but Ānanda interceded on their behalf and Mahāpajāpatī’s ordination was granted on condition that she abide by eight rules of respect. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.253<em>ff.</em></span> <span class="ref">AN.iv.274<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>After her ordination, Pajāpatī came to the Buddha and worshipped him.

Later, at an assembly of monks and nuns in Jetavana, the Buddha declared Pajāpatī chief of those who were long ordained. <span class="ref">AN.i.25</span></p><p>It is said that once Pajāpatī made a robe for the Buddha of wonderful material and marvellously elaborate. But when it came to be offered to the Buddha he refused it, and suggested it should be given to the Order as a whole. Pajāpatī was greatly disappointed, and Ānanda intervened. But the Buddha explained that his suggestion was for the greater good of Pajāpatī, and also as an example to those who might wish to make similar gifts in the future. This was the occasion for the preaching of the Dakkhiṇāvibhaṅga Sutta. <span class="ref">MN.iii.253<em>ff.</em></span> The Buddha had a great love for Pajāpatī, and when she lay ill, as there were no monks to visit her and preach to her the Buddha went himself to preach to her. <span class="ref">Vin.iv.56</span></p><p>Her Therīgāthā verses speak of offering homage to the Buddha, and how she had been a relative of his in many past lives.

<dd>
<p>The second of the Chief Disciples of the Buddha. He and Sāriputta went forth as disciples of Sañjaya. After some time, Sāriputta, wandering about in Rājagaha, met Assaji, was converted by him to the faith of the Buddha, and became a <i>sotāpanna</i>. He found Moggallāna and repeated the stanza he had heard from Assaji <i>ye dhammā hetuppabhavā</i>, etc., and Moggallāna also became a <i>sotāpanna</i>. The two then resolved to visit the Buddha at Veḷuvana, after an unsuccessful attempt to persuade Sañjaya to accompany them. Sañjaya’s disciples, however, five hundred in number, agreed to go, and they all arrived at Veḷuvana. The Buddha preached to them, and ordained them by saying, ”Come, monks.” <span class="ref">Vin.i.39<em>ff.</em></span> Moggallāna went to the hamlet of Kallavāla <span class="ref">AN.iv.85<em>f.</em></span> in Māgadha, and there, on the seventh day after his ordination, drowsiness overcame him as he sat meditating. The Buddha knew this, and appearing before him, exhorted him to be zealous. That very day he attained arahantship.</p><p>Sāriputta and Moggallāna are declared to be the ideal disciples, whose example others should try to follow.<span class="ref">SN.ii.235</span> <span class="ref">AN.i.88</span> In the Saccavibhaṅga Sutta <span class="ref">MN.iii.248</span> the Buddha thus distinguishes these “twin brethren” from the others— “Sāriputta is as she who brings forth and Moggallāna is as the nurse of what is brought forth; Sāriputta trains in the fruits of conversion, Moggallāna trains in the highest good.” Moggallāna’s pre eminence lay in his possession of psychic power. <span class="ref">AN.i.23</span> He could create a living shape innumerable times and could transfer himself into any shape at will. <span class="ref">Thag.1183</span> When the Buddha and his monks failed to get alms in Verañja, Moggallāna offered to turn the earth upside down, so that the essence of the earth, which lay on the under surface, might serve as food. He also offered to open a way from Nalerupu, that the monks might easily go there for alms; but this offer was refused by the Buddha. <span class="ref">Vin.iii.7</span></p><p>Several instances are given of this special display of <i>iddhi</i>. Once, at the Buddha’s request, with his great toe he shook the Migāramātupāsāda, and made it rattle in order to terrify some monks who sat in the ground floor of the building, talking loosely and frivolously, regardless even of the fact that the Buddha was in the upper story. <span class="ref">SN.v.269<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>On another occasion, when Moggallāna visited Sakka to find out if he had profited by the Buddha’s teaching, he found him far too proud and obsessed by the thought of his own splendour. He thereupon shook Sakka’s palace, Vejayanta, till Sakka’s hair stood on end with fright and his pride was humbled. <span class="ref">MN.i.251<em>ff.</em></span> Again, Moggallāna is mentioned as visiting the Brahma world in order to help the Buddha in quelling the arrogance of Baka Brahmā. He himself questioned Baka in solemn conclave in the Sudhamma-Hall in the Brahma world and made him confess his conviction that his earlier views were erroneous. <span class="ref">Thag.1198</span> <span class="ref">SN.i.144<em>f.</em></span> Other visits of his to the Brahma world are also recorded when he held converse with Tissa Brahmā. <span class="ref">AN.iii.331<em>ff.</em></span> <span class="ref">AN.iv.75<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>In the Māratajjanīya Sutta <span class="ref">MN.i.332<em>ff.</em></span> we are told how Māra worried Moggallāna by entering into his belly, but Moggallāna ordered him out and told him how he himself had once been a Māra named Dūsī whose sister Kāḷī was the mother of the present Māra. Dūsī incited the householders against Kakusandha Buddha and was, as a result, born in purgatory.</p><p>Moggallāna could see petas and other spirits invisible to the ordinary mortal eye. <span class="ref">SN.ii.254<em>ff.</em></span> We are told <span class="ref">SN.v.366<em>f.</em></span> that Moggallāna’s visits to the deva worlds were very welcome to the devas.</p><p>The Buddha paid a compliment to Moggallāna’s powers of preaching, when, having preached himself to the Sākyans in their new Mote Hall at Kapilavatthu, he asked Moggallāna, after their departure, to talk to the monks, as he himself was weary. And Moggallāna spoke to them of lusts and of the means of getting rid of them. At the end of the sermon the Buddha praised him warmly. <span class="ref">SN.iv.183<em>ff.</em></span> Mention is made elsewhere <span class="ref">SN.iv.262–26​9</span> of eloquent sermons preached by him on the <i>jhānas</i>, on qualities which lead to true emancipation, <span class="ref">AN.v.155<em>ff.</em></span> and of visits paid to him by Sakka in company with numerous other gods in order to hear him preach. Other devas also went to hear him—​​e.g., Candana, Suyāma, Santusita, Sunimitta and Vasavatti <span class="ref">SN.iv.269–2​80</span> He was also consulted by those, such as Vacchagotta, <span class="ref">SN.iv.391<em>ff.</em></span> and Vappa, <span class="ref">AN.ii.196<em>ff.</em></span> eager to learn from him the teachings of the Buddha. The Buddha placed great faith in his two chief disciples and looked to them to keep the Order pure. There is one instance recorded of Moggallāna seizing a wicked monk, thrusting outside and bolting the door. <span class="ref">AN.iv.204<em>ff.</em></span> Once, when a monk charged Sāriputta with having offended him as he was about to start on a journey, Moggallāna and Ānanda went from lodging to lodging to summon the monks that they might hear Sāriputta vindicate himself. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.236</span> <span class="ref">AN.iv.374</span></p><p>Their fame had reached even to the Brahma world, for we find Tudu Brahmā singing their praises, much to the annoyance of the Kokālika monk.<span class="ref">AN.v.170<em>ff.</em></span> <span class="ref">Snp.p.231<em>ff.</em></span> When Devadatta created a schism among the monks and took five hundred of them to Gayāsīsa, the Buddha sent Sāriputta and Moggallāna to bring them back. They were successful in this mission. Kakudha Koliyaputta, once servant of Moggallāna and later born in a huge manomayakāya, had warned Moggallāna of Devadatta’s intrigues against the Buddha, but the Buddha ignored this information carried to him by Moggallāna.<span class="ref">Vin.ii.185</span> <span class="ref">AN.iii.122<em>ff.</em></span> Moggallāna seems to have carried out diligently the charge laid on him by the Buddha of looking after the monks’ welfare. Among the verses attributed to him in the Theragāthā are several containing exhortations to his colleagues. <span class="ref">Thag.1146–1149</span> <span class="ref">Thag.1165<em>f.</em></span> Some of the colleagues are mentioned by name—​​e.g., Tissa, Vaḍḍhamāna and Potthila.<span class="ref">Thag.1162</span> <span class="ref">Thag.1163</span> <span class="ref">Thag.1174<em>f.</em></span> Elsewhere <span class="ref">SN.i.194<em>f.</em></span> mention is made of his living at Kāḷasilā, with a company of five hundred monks, watching over them and discovering that all were arahants. Vaṅgīsa witnessed this and praised Moggallāna in verse before the Buddha.</p><p>The love existing between Moggallāna and Sāriputta was mutual, as was the admiration. Sāriputta’s verses in praise of Moggallāna <span class="ref">Thag.1178–11​81</span> are even more eloquent than those of Moggallāna in praise of Sāriputta. <span class="ref">Thag.1176</span> Their strongest bond was the love of each for the Buddha; when away from him, they would relate to each other how they had been conversing with him by means of the divine ear and the divine eye. <span class="ref">SN.ii.275<em>ff.</em></span> Moggallāna elsewhere also <span class="ref">SN.ii.273<em>f.</em></span> tells the monks of a conversation he held with the Buddha by means of these divine powers. For another discussion between Sāriputta and Moggallāna, see. <span class="ref">AN.ii.154<em>f.</em></span></p><p>In the Mahāgosiṅga Sutta <span class="ref">MN.i.212</span> we find them staying in the Gosiṅgasālavana in the company of Mahā Kassapa, Ānanda, Revata and Anuruddha, engaged in friendly discussion, referring their conclusions to the Buddha for his opinion. Sāriputta, Moggallāna, and Anuruddha are again mentioned <span class="ref">SN.v.174<em>f.</em></span> <span class="ref">SN.v.299</span> as staying in the Ketakīvana in Sāketa. Among discussions between Anuruddha and Moggallāna is recorded one in which Anuruddha speaks of the value of cultivating the four <i>satipaṭṭhānas</i>. <span class="ref">SN.v.294<em>f.</em></span> It seems to have been usual for Sāriputta and Moggallāna, in their journeys, to travel together at the head of the monks, and lay disciples, who gave alms to the monks, were anxious to include them in their invitations. <span class="ref">AN.iii.336</span> <span class="ref">AN.iv.63</span></p><p>Sāriputta dies before Moggallāna. The Theragāthā contains several verses attributed to Moggallāna regarding Sāriputta’s death. <span class="ref">Thag.1158–1161</span> Moggallāna evidently dies before the Buddha, as the Saṃyutta contains a reference to the Buddha speaking of them both as dead. However the early texts contain no record of the circumstances of Moggallāna’s death.</p>

Seeing the grass mat on which the Buddha slept at night, he inquired whose it was, and, on being told, he was very annoyed, calling the Buddha a rigid repressionist. Bhāradvāja protested, whereupon Māgaṇḍiya offered to repeat his charge to the Buddha’s face.

</div><p>One of the four chief kingdoms of India at the time of the Buddha, the others being Kosala, the kingdom of the Vaṃsas and Avanti. Māgadha formed one of the sixteen Mahājanapadas and had its capital at Rājagaha or Giribbaja where Bimbisāra, and after him Ajātasattu, reigned. Later, Pāṭaliputta became the capital. By the time of Bimbisāra, Aṅga, too, formed a part of Māgadha, and he was known as king of Aṅga Māgadha. Thus Bimbisāra sends for Soṇa Koḷivisa, a prominent citizen of Campā, capital of Aṅga. <span class="ref">Vin.i.27</span> In the Buddha’s day, Māgadha consisted of eighty thousand villages. <span class="ref">Vin.i.179</span></p><p>Ajātasattu succeeded in annexing Kosala with the help of the Licchavis, and he succeeded also in bringing the confederation of the latter under his sway; preliminaries to this struggle are mentioned in the books. <span class="ref">DN.ii.73<em>f.</em></span> <span class="ref">DN.ii.86</span></p><p>At the time of the Buddha, the kingdom of Māgadha was bounded on the east by the river Campā, on the south by the Vindhyā Mountains, on the west by the river Soṇa, and on the north by the Ganges. The latter river formed the boundary between Māgadha and the republican country of the Licchavis, and both the Māgadhas and the Licchavis evidently had equal rights over the river.</p><p>During the early Buddhist period Māgadha was an important political and commercial centre, and was visited by people from all parts of Northern India in search of commerce and of learning. The kings of Māgadha maintained friendly relations with their neighbours, Bimbisāra and Pasenadi marrying each other’s sisters. When Candappajjota of Ujjeni was suffering from jaundice, Bimbisāra sent him his own personal physician, Jīvaka.</p><p>In Māgadha was the real birth of Buddhism (see, e.g., the words put in the mouth of Sahampati: <i>pātur ahosi Magadhesu pubbe dhammo</i> <span class="ref">Vin.i.5</span> ), and it was from Māgadha that it spread after the Third Council. The Buddha’s chief disciples, Sāriputta and Moggallāna, came from Māgadha. The cornfields of Māgadha were rich and fertile. <span class="ref">Thag.208</span></p><p>The names of several places in Māgadha occur in the books—​​e.g., Ekanālā, NāIakagāma, Senānigama, Khāṇumata, Andhakavindha, Macala, Matula, Ambalaṭṭhikā, Pāṭaligāma, NāIandā and SāIindiya.</p><p>Māgadha is identified with the modern South Behar.</p>

<p>Generally regarded as the personification of Death, the Evil One, the Tempter.

The commonest use of the word was evidently in the sense of Death. From this it was extended to mean “the world under the sway of death” <span class="ref">AN.iv.228</span> and the beings therein. Thence, the <i>kilesas</i> also came to be called Māra in that they were instruments of Death, the causes enabling Death to hold sway over the world. All Temptations brought about by the <i>kilesas</i> were likewise regarded as the work of Death. There was also evidently a legend of a <i>devaputta</i> of the Vasavatti world, called Māra, who considered himself the head of the Kāmāvacara world and who recognized any attempt to curb the enjoyment of sensual pleasures, as a direct challenge to himself and to his authority. As time went on these different conceptions of the word became confused one with the other, but this confusion is not always difficult to unravel.</p><p>Various statements are found in the Pitakas connected with Māra, which have, obviously, reference to Death, the <i>kilesas</i>, and the world over which Death and the <i>kilesas</i> hold sway. <span class="ref">SN.iv.91</span> <span class="ref">SN.iii.73</span> <span class="ref">Dhp.8</span> <span class="ref">Dhp.40</span> <span class="ref">SN.i.135</span></p><p>The legend of Māra attacking the Buddha to prevent his Awakening had its origin in the Padhāna Sutta. <span class="ref">Snp.494–517</span> There Māra is represented as visiting Gotama on the banks of the Nerañjara, where he is practicing austerities and tempting him to abandon his striving and devote himself to good works. Gotama refers to Māra’s army as being tenfold. The divisions are as follows: the first consists of the Lusts; the second is Aversion; the third Hunger and Thirst; the fourth Craving; the fifth Sloth and Indolence; the sixth Cowardice; the seventh Doubt; the eighth Hypocrisy and Stupidity; Gains, Fame, Honour and Glory falsely obtained form the ninth; and the tenth is the Lauding of oneself and the Contemning of others. “Seeing this army on all sides,” says the Buddha, “I go forth to meet Māra with his equipage. He shall not make me yield ground. That army of thine, which the world of devas and men conquers not, even that, with my wisdom, will I smite, as an unbaked earthen bowl with a stone.” Here we have practically all the elements found in the later elaborated versions.</p><p>The second part of the Padhāna Sutta <span class="ref">Snp.446<em>f.</em></span> <span class="ref">SN.i.122</span> is obviously concerned with later events in the life of Gotama. After Māra had retired discomfited, he followed the Buddha for seven years, watching for any transgression on his part. But the quest was in vain, and, “like a crow attacking a rock,” he left Gotama in disgust. “The lute of Māra, who was so overcome with grief, slipped from his arm. Then, in dejection, the Yakkha disappeared thence.”</p><p>The Saṃyutta Nikāya <span class="ref">SN.i.124<em>f.</em></span> <span class="ref">AN.v.46</span> also contains a sutta in which three daughters of Māra are represented as tempting the Buddha after his Enlightenment. Their names are Taṇhā, Arati and Ragā, and they are evidently personifications of three of the ten forces in Māra’s army, as given in the Padhāna Sutta. They assume numerous forms of varying age and charm, full of blandishment, but their attempt is vain, and they are obliged to admit defeat.</p><p>Once Māra came to be regarded as the Spirit of Evil all temptations of lust, fear, greed, etc., were regarded as his activities, and Māra was represented as assuming various disguises in order to carry out his nefarious plans. Thus the books mention various occasions on which Māra appeared before the Buddha himself and his disciples, men and women, to lure them away from their chosen path.</p><p>Soon after the Buddha’s first vassa, Māra approached him and asked him not to teach the monks regarding the highest emancipation, he himself being yet bound by Māra’s fetters. But the Buddha replied that he was free of all fetters, human and divine. <span class="ref">Vin.i.22</span> On another occasion Māra entered into the body of Vetambarī and made him utter heretical doctrines. <span class="ref">SN.i.67</span> In the Brahmanimantanika Sutta. <span class="ref">MN.i.326</span> Māra is spoken of as entering the hearts even of the inhabitants of the Brahma world. The Māra Saṃyutta <span class="ref">SN.i.103<em>ff.</em></span> contains several instances of Māra’s temptations of the Buddha by assailing him with doubts as to his emancipation, feelings of fear and dread, appearing before him in the shape of an elephant, a cobra, in various guises beautiful and ugly, making the rocks of Gijjhakūṭa fall with a crash; by making him wonder whether he should ever sleep; by suggesting that, as human life was long, there was no need for haste in living the good life; by dulling the intelligence of his hearers. <span class="ref">DN.iii.58</span> In the account of Godhika’s suicide <span class="ref">SN.i.122</span> there is a curious statement that, after Godhika died, Māra went about looking for his consciousness, and the Buddha pointed him out to the monks, “going about like a cloud of smoke.”</p><p>The books mention many occasions on which Māra assumed various forms under which to tempt bhikkhunīs, often in lonely spots—​​e.g., Āḷavikā, Kisāgotamī, Somā, Vijayā, Uppalavantnā, Cālā, Upacālā, Sisūpacālā, Selā, Vajirā and Khemā.</p><p>Mention is made, especially in the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta, of several occasions on which Māra approached the Buddha, requesting him to die; the first of these occasions was under the Ajapala Banyan tree at Uruvelā, soon after the Enlightenment, but the Buddha refused to die until the sāsana was firmly established.</p><p>With the accounts of Māra, as the personification of Evil, came to be mixed legends of an actual <i>devaputta</i>, named Māra, also called Vasavatti, because he was an inhabitant of the Paranimmitā Vasavatti deva world. In the Aṅguttara Nikāya, Māra is described as the head of those enjoying bliss in the Kāmāvacara worlds. <span class="ref">AN.ii.17</span> In the Māratajjanīya Sutta <span class="ref">MN.i.333</span> <span class="ref">DN.iii.79</span> Moggallāna says that he too had once been a Māra, Dūsī by name; Kālā was his sister’s name, and the Māra of the present age was his nephew. In the sutta, Dūsī is spoken of as having been responsible for many acts of mischief, similar to those ascribed to the Māra of Gotama’s day. According to the sutta, Māradevaputta was evidently regarded as a being of great power, with a strong bent for mischief, especially directed against holy men.</p>

<p>A group of monks, followers of Mettiya and Bhummajaka forming part of the Chabbaggiyā (Group of Six Monks).</p><p>Twice they brought an unfounded charge of breach of morality against Dabba Mallaputta, who seems to have earned their special dislike. Dabba was in charge of the distribution of alms at the ārāma where they stayed, and one day it was their turn to receive alms from a certain householder who had a reputation for providing good food. When, however, the man heard from Dabba that it was the turn of the Mettiyabhummajakā to receive his hospitality, he was much displeased, and ordered his female slave to look after them. The monks were greatly annoyed, and accused Dabba of having slandered them to the householder. They, therefore, persuaded a nun named Mettiyā to go to the Buddha and accuse Dabba of having violated her chastity.

<dt><dfn>Yakkha</dfn></dt>
<dd>
<p>A class of non human beings generally described as non-human. They are mentioned with Devas, Rakkhasas, Dānavas, Gandhabbas, Kinnaras, and Mahoragas (? Nāgas).</p><p>Elsewhere <span class="ref">AN.ii.38</span> they rank, in progressive order, between <i>manussā</i> and <i>gandhabbā</i>. They are of many different kinds: spirits, ogres, dryads, ghosts, spooks. In the early records, <i>yakkha</i>, like <i>nāga</i>, as an appellative, was anything but depreciative. Thus not only is Sakka, king of the gods, so referred to, <span class="ref">MN.i.252</span> but even the Buddha is spoken of as a <i>yakkha</i> in poetic diction. <span class="ref">MN.i.386</span> Many gods, such as Kakudha, are so addressed. <span class="ref">SN.i.54</span> Of these above named, the followers of Vessavaṇa appear to be the Yakkhas proper. The term <i>yakkha</i> as applied to <i>purisa</i> is evidently used in an exceptionally philosophical sense as meaning “soul” in such passages as ettāvatā yakkhassa suddhi, <span class="ref">Snp.478</span> or <i>ettāvat’ aggam no vadanti h’ ekā, yakkhassa suddhim idha paṇḍitāse</i>. <span class="ref">Snp.875</span></p><p>The cult of <i>yakkhas</i> seems to have arisen primarily from the woods and secondarily from the legends of sea faring merchants. To the latter origin belong the stories connected with vimānas found in or near the sea or in lakes. Generally speaking, the Yakkhas were decadent divinities, beings half deified, having a deva’s supernormal powers, particularly as regards influencing people, partly helpful, partly harmful. They are sometimes called <i>devatā</i> <span class="ref">SN.i.205</span> or <i>devaputta</i>. Some of these, like Indakūta and Sūciloma, are capable of intelligent questioning on metaphysics and ethics. All of them possess supernatural powers; they can transfer themselves at will, to any place, with their abodes, and work miracles, such as assuming any shape at will.</p><p>Sometimes the Yakkhas have been degraded to the state of red eyed cannibal ogres. The female Yakkhas (Yakkhinī) are, in these cases, more fearful and evil minded than the male. They eat flesh and blood and devour even men. <span class="ref">DN.ii.346</span></p><p>Ordinarily the attitude of the Yakkhas towards man is one of benevolence. They are interested in the spiritual welfare of the human beings with whom they come in contact and somewhat resemble tutelary genii. In the Āṭānāṭiya Sutta, <span class="ref">DN.iii.194<em>f.</em></span> however, the Yakkha king, Vessavaṇa, is represented as telling the Buddha that, for the most part, the Yakkhas believe neither in the Buddha nor in his teachings, which enjoin upon his followers abstention from various evils and are therefore distasteful to some of the Yakkhas. Such Yakkhas are disposed to molest the followers of the Buddha in their woodland haunts. Cp. the story of the Yakkha who wished to kill Sāriputta. <span class="ref">Ud.iv.4</span> But the Mahā Yakkhas, <span class="ref">DN.iii.204<em>f.</em></span> the generals and commanders among Yakkhas, are always willing to help holy men and to prevent wicked Yakkhas from hurting them. Among Yakkhas are some beings who are <i>sotāpannas</i>—​​e.g., Janavasabha, Sūciloma and Khara. The case of the Yakkha Vajirapāṇi is of special interest. <i>D.i.95</i> He is represented as a kind of mentor, hovering in the air, threatening to kill Ambaṭṭha, if he does not answer the Buddha’s question the third time he is asked. In many cases the Yakkhas are “fallen angels” and come eagerly to listen to the word of the Buddha in order to be able to rise to a higher sphere of existence e.g., Piyaṅkaramātā and Punabbasumātā, and even Vessavaṇa, listening to Veḷukaṇḍakī Nandamātā reciting the Parāyana Vagga. <span class="ref">AN.iv.63</span> At the preaching of the Mahāsamaya Sutta many hundreds of thousands of Yakkhas were present among the audience.</p><p>The names of the Yakkhas often give us a clue to their origin and function. These are taken from (a) their bodily appearance e.g., Kuvannā, Khara, Kharaloma, Kharadāthika, Citta, Cittarāja, Silesaloma, Sūciloma and Hāritā; (b) their place of residence, attributes of their realms, animals, plants, etc. e.g., Ajakalāpaka, Āḷavaka (forest dweller), Uppala, Kakudha (name of plant), Kumbhīra, Gumbiya, Disāmukha, Yamamoli, Vajira, Vajirapāṇi or Vajirabāhu, Sātāgira, Serīsaka; (c) qualities of character, etc. e.g., Adhamma, Katattha, Dhamma, Puṇṇaka, Māra, Sakaṭa; (d) embodiments of former persons e.g., Janavasabha (lord of men= Bimbisāra), Dīgha, Naradeva, Paṇḍaka, Sīvaka, Serī.</p><p>Vessavaṇa is often mentioned as king of the Yakkhas. He is one of the four Regent Gods, and the Āṭānāṭiya Sutta <span class="ref">DN.iii.199<em>ff.</em></span> contains a vivid description of the Yakkha kingdom of Uttarakuru, with its numerous cities, crowds of inhabitants, parks, lakes and assembly halls. Vessavaṇa is also called Kuvera, and the Yakkhas are his servants and messengers. They wait upon him in turn.</p><p>No one, apparently, is free from this necessity of waiting upon the king even Janavasabba has to run errands for Vessavaṇa. <span class="ref">DN.ii.207</span> The Yakkhas hold regular assemblies. <span class="ref">DN.iii.201</span></p><p>It is sometimes difficult to decide whether the Yakkhas were non-humans spirits or aboriginal tribespeople. In the Vinaya, intercourse with <i>yakkhas</i> is forbidden. <span class="ref">Vin.iii.37</span> <span class="ref">Vin.iv.20</span></p>

<p>He was the son of a very wealthy treasurer of Benares, and was brought up in great luxury, living in three mansions, according to the seasons and surrounded with all kinds of pleasures. Impelled by antecedent conditions, he saw one night the indecorum of his sleeping attendants, and, greatly distressed, put on his gold slippers and left the house and the town, non humans opening the gates for him. He took the direction of Isipatana, exclaiming— “Alas! What distress! Alas! What danger!” The Buddha saw him in the distance and called to him, “Come Yasa, here is neither distress nor danger.” Filled with joy, Yasa took off his slippers and sat beside the Buddha. The Buddha preached to him a graduated discourse, and when he had finished teaching the Truths, Yasa attained realization of the Dhamma. To Yasa’s father, too, who had come in search of his son, the Buddha preached the Doctrine, having first made Yasa invisible to him. At the end of the sermon he acknowledged himself the Buddha’s follower, and Yasa, who had been listening, became an arahant. When, therefore, Yasa’s presence became known to his father, who asked him to return to his grieving mother, the Buddha declared that household life had no attractions for Yasa and granted his request to be admitted to the Order. The next day, at the invitation of Yasa’s father, he went, accompanied by Yasa, to his house, and there, at the conclusion of the meal, he preached to Yasa’s mother and other members of the household, who all became his followers, thus becoming the first tevācikā upāsikā. When Yasa’s intimate friends, Vimala, Subāhu, Punnaji and Gavampati, heard of Yasa’s ordination they followed his example and joined the Order, attaining arahantship in due course, as did fifty others of Yasa’s former friends and acquaintances. <span class="ref">Vin.i.15–20</span></p><p>A verse attributed to him in the Theragāthā says that he attained the Three Knowledges even while still adorned with fine clothes. <span class="ref">Thag.117</span></p>

<p>A monk who lived about a century after the Buddha, and who was one of the leaders in the events of the Second Council. When he arrived at the Kūṭāgārasālā in the Mahāvana, he discovered that the Vajjian monks had raised the “Ten Points” contrary to the Buddha’s teachings, and that they were publicly asking for money from their lay disciples. Yasa thereupon protested against such misdemeanours, and the Vajjian monks, hoping to win him over, offered him a share of the money they had collected.</p><p>This offer he rejected with scorn, and the monks passed on him the <i>Patisārattiyakamma</i> (craving of pardon from lay folk). This necessitated that Yasa should be sent among the laymen, accompanied by a messenger, presumably to ask their pardon for having misinformed them. But instead of this, Yasa told the lay people that the behaviour of the Vajjian monks was completely at variance with the rules laid down by the Buddha, and quoted the Buddha’s discourses to prove his charge.</p><p>When the Vajjian monks heard of this, they pronounced on him the <i>Ukkhepaniyakamma</i> (Act of Suspension), but when they assembled to carry it out, Yasa disappeared through the air to Kosambī, from where he sent messengers to the monks of Avanti, of the west (Pātheyyakā or Pāveyyakā) and of the south (Dakkhiṇāpatha), asking for their assistance in checking the corruption of the religion. With them he visited Sambhūta Sānavāsī at Ahogangapabbata, and there they decided to consult Revata who lived in Soreyya. Yasa, therefore, went to Revata, following him through Saṅkassa, Kaṇṇakujja, Udumbara, Aggalapura and Sahajāti. Having found Revata, he questioned him regarding the ten points, and obtained from him promise of assistance.</p><p>Together they returned to Vesāli, where lived Sabbakāmī, the oldest Thera of the day. After obtaining his opinion on the matter, an assembly of the monks was held and a committee was appointed of four from the East: Sabbakāmī, Sāḷha, Khujjasobhita, and Vāsabhagāmika; and four from the West: Revata, Sambhūta-Sānavāsī, Yasa and Sumana. They debated the question at the Vālikārāma, Revata acting as questioner and Sabbakāmī answering his questions. At the end of the enquiry the decision was given against the ten points of the Vajjian monks, and this decision was conveyed to the assembly. Then the recital of the Vinaya was held in which seven hundred monks participated; this recital was called the Sattasatī. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.294<em>ff.</em></span></p>

<p>The Udāna mentions <span class="ref">Ud.iii.3</span> how Yasoja and five hundred of his companions went to see the Buddha at Jetavana. There they stood talking to the monks who lived there and made a great uproar. The Buddha, sending Ānanda to fetch them, asked them to remove themselves from his presence, as they were behaving like fishermen. Taking his admonition to heart, they returned to the banks of the Vaggumuṇḍā in the Vajji country, and there they determined to lead such lives as would commend them to the Buddha. During the rainy season, they all put forth effort and attained arahantship. Some time after, the Buddha visited Vesāli during a journey and asked Āmaṇḍa to send for Yasoja and his friends as he desired to see them. Ānanda sent a message. When the monks arrived, they found the Buddha lost in meditation, and they, too, seated themselves and entered into samādhi, remaining thus throughout the night. Āmaṇḍa could not understand why the Buddha, having sent for Yasoja and his companions, should have sunk into samādhi without greeting them, and three times during the night he tried to remind the Buddha of their arrival; but the Buddha ignored his warnings and in the morning explained to him that it was more joy for them all to live in the bliss of samādhi than to indulge in mere conversation.</p><p>His Theragāthā verses speak in praise of a thin monk who is dedicated and content, while criticizing those who live in company. <span class="ref">Thag.243–24​5</span></p><p>The Vinaya relates <span class="ref">Vin.i.239</span> how once, when Yasoja was ill, drugs were brought for his use, but as the Buddha had forbidden the use of a special place for storing such things they were left out of doors and were partly eaten by vermin, the remainder being carried away by robbers.

When the Buddha visited Thullakoṭṭhita, Raṭṭhapāla went to hear him preach and decided to leave the world. His parents would not, however, give their consent till he threatened to starve himself to death. Realizing then that he was in earnest, they agreed to let him go on condition that he would visit them after his ordination. Raṭṭhapāla accompanied the Buddha to Sāvatthī, and there, dwelling alone, he attained arahantship within a short time. Then, with the Buddha’s permission, he returned to Thullakoṭṭhita and dwelt in the deer park of the Kuru king. The day after his arrival, while begging for alms, he came to his father’s house. His father was in the entrance hall having his hair combed, but, failing to recognize his son, he started to abuse him, taking him for an ordinary monk, one of those who had robbed him of his son. Just at that moment the slave girl of the house was about to throw away some stale rice, which Raṭṭhapāla begged of her. The girl recognized his voice, gave him the rice and told his parents who he was. When his father came to look for his son, he found him eating stale rice. Having already finished eating, when invited to enter the house, he would not do so, but on the next day he went again, and his father tried to tempt him by making a display of the immense wealth which would be his should he return to the lay life, while his former wives, beautifully clothed, asked him about the nymphs, for whose sake he led the homeless life. “For the sake of no nymphs, Sisters,” he said, and they fell fainting under the shock of being addressed as “Sisters.” Growing impatient at the conduct of his family, he asked for his meal, ate it, preached to them. <span class="ref">MN.i.64<em>f.</em></span> <span class="ref">Thag.769–7​75</span> on the impermanence of all things, the futility of wealth, the snare of beauty, etc., and returned to Migacīra.</p><p>There the Kuru king, who was feasting there, and had often heard of Raṭṭhapāla’s fame, visited him.

</div>A city, the capital of Māgadha.</p><p>The place was called Giribbaja (mountain stronghold) because it was surrounded by five hills—​​Paṇḍava, Gijjhakūṭa, Vebhāra, Isigili and Vepulla. It is said <span class="ref">MN.iii.68</span> that these hills, with the exception of Isigili, were once known by other names e.g., Vaṅkaka for Vepulla. <span class="ref">SN.ii.191</span> The Saṃyutta <span class="ref">SN.i.206</span> mentions another peak near Rājagaha—​​Indakūta.</p><p>Rājagaha was closely associated with the Buddha’s work. He visited it soon after the Renunciation. Bimbisāra saw him begging in the street, and questioned him as to his purpose. <span class="ref">Snp.472–491</span> During the first year after the Enlightenment the Buddha went to Rājagaha from Gayā, after the conversion of the Tebhātika Jatilas. Bimbisāra and his subjects gave the Buddha a great welcome, and the king entertained him and a large following of monks in the palace. It is said that on the day of the Buddha’s entry into the royal quarters, Sakka led the procession, in the guise of a young man, singing songs of praise of the Buddha. <span class="ref">Vin.i.35<em>ff.</em></span> Large numbers of householders joined the Order, and people blamed the Buddha for breaking up their families. But their censure lasted for only seven days. Among those ordained were the Sattarasavaggiyā with Upāli at their head.</p><p>The Buddha spent his first vassa in Rājagaha and remained there during the winter and the following summer. The people grew tired of seeing the monks everywhere, and, on coming to know of their displeasure, the Buddha went first to Dakkhiṇāgiri and then to Kapilavatthu. <span class="ref">Vin.i.77<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>Later the Buddha made Sāvatthī his headquarters, though he seems frequently to have visited and stayed at Rājagaha. It thus became the scene of several important suttas—​​e.g., the Āṭānāṭiya, Udumbarika and Kassapasīhanāda, Jīvaka, Mahāsakuladāyī, and Sakkapañha.</p><p>Many of the Vinaya rules were enacted at Rājagaha. Just before his death, the Buddha paid a last visit there. At that time, Ajātasattu was contemplating an attack on the Vajjians, and sent his minister, Vassakāra, to the Buddha at Gijjhakūṭa, to find out what his chances of success were. <span class="ref">DN.ii.72</span></p><p>After the Buddha’s death, Rājagaha was chosen by the monks, with Mahā Kassapa at their head, as the meeting place of the First Convocation. This took place at the Sattapaṇṇiguhā, and Ajātasattu extended to the undertaking his whole hearted patronage. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.285</span> The king also erected at Rājagaha a cairn over the relics of the Buddha, which he had obtained as his share. <span class="ref">DN.ii.166</span></p><p>Rājagaha was one of the six chief cities of the Buddha’s time, and as such, various important trade routes passed through it. The others cities were Campā, Sāvatthī, Sāketa, Kosambī and Benares. <span class="ref">DN.ii.147</span></p><p>The Parāyana Vagga <span class="ref">Snp.1011–101​3</span> mentions a long and circuitous route, taken by Bāvarī’s disciples in going from Patiṭṭhāna to Rājagaha, passing through Māhissati, Ujjeni, Gonaddha, Vedisa. Vanasavhaya, Kosambī, Sāketa, Sāvatthī, Setavyā, Kapilavatthu, Kusinārā, on to Rājagaha, by way of the usual places. The Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta <span class="ref">DN.ii.72<em>ff.</em></span> gives a list of the places at which the Buddha stopped during his last journey along that road—​​Ambalaṭṭhikā, Nāḷandā, Pāṭaligāma, Koṭigāma, Nādikā, Vesāli, Bhaṇḍagāma, Hatthigāma, Ambagāma, Jambugāma, Bhoganagara, Pāvā, and the Kakuttha River, beyond which lay the Mango grove and the Sāla grove of the Mallas.</p><p>The books mention various places besides Veḷuvana, with its Kalandaka-nivāpa <i>vihāra</i> in and around Rājagaha—​​e.g., Sītavana, Jīvaka’s Ambavana, Pipphaliguhā, Udumbarikārāma, Moranivāpa with its Paribbājakārāma, Tapodārāma, Indasālaguhā in Vediyagiri, Sattapaṇṇiguhā, Latthivana, Maddakucchi, Supatiṭṭhacetiya, Pāsānakacetiya, Sappasoṇḍikapabbhāra and the pond Sumāgadhā.</p><p>The city gates were closed every evening, and after that it was impossible to enter the city. <span class="ref">Vin.iv.116<em>f.</em></span></p><p>Ajātasattu was afraid of invasion by the Licchavis, and Vassakāra is mentioned as having strengthened its fortifications.

<p>An Asura chieftain.

<p>Only son of Gotama Buddha. When the Buddha visited Kapilavatthu for the first time after his Enlightenment and accepted Suddhodana’s invitation, Rāhula’s mother sent the boy to the Buddha to ask for his inheritance. The Buddha gave him no answer, and, at the conclusion of the meal, left the palace. Rāhula followed him, reiterating his request until at last the Buddha asked Sāriputta to ordain him. When Suddhodana heard of this he protested to the Buddha, and asked as a boon that, in future, no child should be ordained without the consent of his parents, and to this the Buddha agreed. <span class="ref">Vin.i.82<em>f.</em></span></p><p>When Rāhula was seven years old, the Buddha preached to him the Ambalaṭṭhikā Rāhulovāda Sutta as a warning that he should never lie, even in fun. Rāhula used to accompany the Buddha on his begging rounds.</p><p>Rāhula noticed that he harboured carnal thoughts fascinated by his own physical beauty and that of his father, the Buddha preached to him, at the age of eighteen, the Mahā Rāhulovāda Sutta. Two other suttas, also called Rāhulovāda, one included in the Saṃyutta and the other in the Aṅguttara, formed the topics for Rāhula’s meditation.</p><p>Later, the Buddha, knowing that Rāhula’s mind was ripe for final attainment, went with him alone to Andhavana, and preached to him the Cūḷa Rāhulovāda Sutta. At the end of the discourse, Rāhula became an arahant, together with one hundred thousand crores of listening devas.</p><p>The Buddha declared Rāhula foremost among those of his disciples who were anxious for training. <span class="ref">AN.i.24</span> The Vinaya <span class="ref">Vin.iii.16</span> gives a story illustrating Rāhula’s extreme conscientiousness in the observance of rules. He arrived one evening at Kosambī, when the Buddha was staying there in the Badarikārāma. Rāhula was told there of a new rule which had been laid down to the effect that no novice should sleep under the same roof as a fully ordained monk. Unable to find any resting place which did not violate this rule, Rāhula spent the night in the Buddha’s bathroom. When the Buddha discovered him there the next morning, he modified the rule.</p><p>Four verses uttered by Rāhula are included in the Theragāthā, where he says he s twice blessed to be an arahant and the Buddha’s son. <span class="ref">Thag.295–298</span></p>

</div><p>A powerful tribe of India in the time of the Buddha. They were certainly <i>khattiyas</i>, for on that ground they claimed a share of the Buddha’s relics. <span class="ref">DN.ii.165</span></p><p>Their capital was Vesāli, and they formed a part of the Vajjian confederacy, being often referred to as the Vajjīs. They were beautiful to look at and wore brilliantly coloured garments, riding in brightly painted carriages.<span class="ref">DN.ii.96</span> <span class="ref">AN.iii.219</span> The Buddha once compared them to the gods of Tāvatiṃsā. <span class="ref">DN.ii.96</span></p><p>Though this would seem to indicate that they were very prosperous and rich, they do not appear to have lived in luxury and idleness. They are, on the contrary, spoken of <span class="ref">SN.ii.267<em>f.</em></span> as sleeping on straw couches, being strenuous and diligent and zealous in their service. They also practised seven conditions of welfare, which the Buddha claimed to have taught them at the Sārandada cetiya. <span class="ref">DN.ii.73<em>f.</em></span></p><p>The young men among the Licchavis were evidently fond of archery, for mention is made <span class="ref">AN.iii.76</span> of large numbers of them roving about in the Mahāvana, with bows and arrows, the strings set, and surrounded by hounds. They were a martial people and fond of “sport,” but we find one of their Elders, Mahānāma complaining <span class="ref">AN.iii.76</span> of them to the Buddha— “The Licchavi youths are quick tempered, rough and greedy fellows; such presents as are sent by the members of their tribe sugar cane, jujubes, sweet cakes, sweetmeats, etc. they loot and eat; they slap the women and girls of their tribe on the back.” Violation of chastity was considered a serious offence among the Licchavis, and the assembly would even give its consent to a husband’s request that his unfaithful wife should be murdered. <span class="ref">Vin.iv.225</span></p><p>According to the Buddhist books, the Licchavis were devout followers of the Buddha and held him in the highest esteem. Five hundred Licchavis once gave a garment each to Piṅgiyāni, because he recited a verse in praise of the Buddha. <span class="ref">AN.iii.239</span> Even careless boys, referred to above as wandering about with hounds and bows and arrows, would lay aside their arms when they saw the Buddha seated under a tree and would surround him with clasped hands, eager to hear him. <span class="ref">AN.iii.76</span> There were numerous shrines in Vesāli itself, several of which are mentioned by name: Cāpāla, Sattambaka, Bahuputta, Gotama, Sārandada and Udena. It is, however, apparent from the Buddhist books themselves that Vesāli was also a stronghold of the Jains. The Buddha visited Vesāli at least three times, and is frequently mentioned as staying in Kūṭāgārasālā in Mahāvana. There the Licchavis visited him in large numbers, sometimes <span class="ref">AN.v.133<em>f.</em></span> disturbing the calm of the spot and obliging resident monks to seek peace in Gosiṅgasālavana near by. Once, five hundred Licchavis invited the Buddha to a discussion held by them at the Sārandada-cetiya regarding the five kinds of treasures. The Buddha went and gave his opinion. <span class="ref">AN.iii.167<em>f.</em></span></p><p>But not all the Licchavis were followers of the Buddha. When Saccaka the Nigaṇṭha visited the Buddha at Mahāvana, he was accompanied by five hundred Licchavis, who did not all salute the Buddha as their teacher, but showed him only such respect as was due to an honoured stranger. <span class="ref">MN.i.229</span> Several eminent Licchavis are specially mentioned by name as having visited and consulted the Buddha; among whom are Mahānāma, Sīha, Bhaddiya, Sāḷha, Abhaya, Panditakumāra, Nandaka, Mahāli and Ugga. Several Licchavis, both men and women, joined the Order—​​e.g., the famous courtesan Ambapālī, Jentī, Sīha and Vāsitthī, and, among monks, Añjanavaniya, Vajjiputta and Sambhūta.</p><p>The Licchavis were greatly admired for their system of government. It was a republic (<i>gaṇa</i>, <i>saṅghā</i>), all the leading members of which were called <i>rājā</i>. They held full and frequent assemblies at which problems affecting either the whole republic or individual members were fully discussed. The Buddha enjoins on the monks the observance of the same habits as practised by the Licchavis. These are given at. <span class="ref">DN.ii.76<em>f.</em></span> <span class="ref">Vin.i.56</span></p><p>In their political relationships with their neighbours, the Licchavis seem to have been on friendly terms with Bimbisāra, king of Māgadha, and with Pasenadi, king of Kosala. <span class="ref">MN.ii.101</span></p><p>After the death of Bimbisāra, Ajātasattu, in his desire for the expansion of Māgadha, resolved to destroy the Licchavis. In order to discover what the Buddha thought of his chances of success, he sent to him his minister Vassakāra. The Buddha predicted <span class="ref">DN.ii.72<em>ff.</em></span> that as long as the Licchavis remained united they were proof against any foe. But we also find reference to their giving up their earlier austere habits and to their fondness for soft pillows, long sleep and other luxuries. <span class="ref">SN.ii.268</span></p>

</div><p>A tribe in North India, to which the Buddha belonged. Their capital was Kapilavatthu. Mention is also made of other Sākyan settlements - e.g., Cātumā, Khomadussa, Sāmagāma, Devadaha, Sīlavatī, Nagaraka, Medatalumpa, Sakkhara and Ulumpa (q.v.). Within the Sākyan tribe there were probably several clans, gottā. The Buddha himself belonged to the Gotamagotta. It has been suggested (E.g., Thomas, op. cit., 22) that this was a brahmin clan, claiming descent from the ancient isi Gotama. The evidence for this suggestion is, however, very meagre. Nowhere do we find the Sākyans calling themselves brahmins. On the other hand, we find various clans claiming a share of the Buddha's relics on the ground that they, like the Buddha, were khattiyas <span class="ref">D.ii.165</span>. It is stated a that the Sākyans were a haughty people. <span class="ref">Vin.ii.183</span> <span class="ref">D.i.90</span> <span class="ref">J. i.88</span> <span class="ref">DhA.iii.163</span>.

The Buddha then performed a miracle and preached the Vessantara Jātaka, and their pride was subdued. They evidently fond of sports and mention is made of a special school of archery conducted by a Sākyan family, called Vedhaññā <span class="ref">D.iii.117</span> <span class="ref">DA.iii.905</span>.</p><p>The Sākyans evidently had no king. Theirs was a republican form of government, probably with a leader, elected from time to time. The administration and judicial affairs of the gotta were discussed in their Santhāgāra, or Mote Hall, at Kapilavatthu. See, e.g., <span class="ref">D.i.91</span> the Sākyans had a similar Mote Hall at Cātumā <span class="ref">M.i.457</span>. The Mallas of Kusinārā also had a Santhāgāra <span class="ref">D.ii.164</span>; so did the Licchavis of Vesāli <span class="ref">Vin.i.233</span> <span class="ref">M.i.228</span>.</p><p>Ambattha (q.v.) once visited it on business; so did the envoys of Pasenadi, when he wished to marry a Sākyan maiden (see below). A new Mote Hall was built at Kapilavatthu while the Buddha was staying at the Nigrodhārāma, and he was asked to inaugurate it. This he did by a series of ethical discourses lasting through the night, delivered by himself, Ananda, and Moggallāna. <span class="ref">M.i.353f.</span> <span class="ref">S. iv.182f</span> the hall is described at <span class="ref">SA.iii.63</span> cf. <span class="ref">UdA.409</span>.</p><p>The Sākyans were very jealous of the purity of their race; they belonged to the Ādiccagotta, (ādiccā nāma gottena, Sākiyā nāma jātiyā, <span class="ref">Sn. vs.423</span>) and claimed descent from Okkāka (q.v.). Their ancestors were the nine children of Okkāka, whom he banished in order to give the kingdom to Jantukumāra, his son by another queen. These nine children went towards Himavā, and, having founded Kapilavatthu (q.v. for details), lived there. To the eldest sister they gave the rank of mother, and the others married among themselves. The eldest sister, Piyā, later married Rāma, king of Benares, and their descendants became known as the Koliyans (see Koliyā for details). When Okkāka heard of this, he praised their action, saying, "Sakyā vata bho kumārā, paramasakyā vata bho rājakumāra; hence their name came to be "Sakyā."</p><p>The Buddha states, in the Aggañña Sutta, that the Sākyans were vassals of King Pasenadi of Kosala. <span class="ref">D.iii.83</span> (Sakyā . . . Pasenadi-Kosalassa anuyuttā bhavanti, karonti Sakyā rañño Pasenadimhi Kosale nipaccakāram abhivādanam paccupatthānam añjalikammam sāmīcikammam); cf. <span class="ref">Sn.vs 422</span>, where the Buddha describes his country as being "Kosalesu niketino."</p>

There, at his request, the Buddha visited him and comforted him. He questioned Vakkali, who assured him that he had no cause to reprove himself with regard to morals; his only worry was that he had not been able to see the Buddha earlier. The Buddha told him that seeing the Dhamma was equivalent to seeing him, and because Vakkali had realized the Dhamma, there would be no hereafter for him. After the Buddha had left, Vakkali asked his attendants to take him to Kāḷasilā on Isigili. The Buddha was on Gijjhakūṭa and was told by two devas that Vakkali was about to “obtain release.” The Buddha sent word to him— “Fear not, Vakkali, your dying will not be evil.” Vakkali rose from his bed to receive the Buddha’s message, and sending word to the Buddha that he had no desire or love for the body or the other <i>khandhas</i>, he drew a knife and killed himself. The Buddha went to see his body, and declared that he had obtained Nibbāna and that Māra’s attempt to find the consciousness of Vakkali would prove useless.</p>

<p>A wanderer who later became an arahant Thera. Several conversations he had with the Buddha are mentioned in the books.

The Saṃyutta Nikāya contains a whole section on Vacchagotta; his discussions were chiefly concerned with such mythical questions as to whether the world is eternal, the nature of life, the existence or otherwise of the Tathāgata after death, etc. <span class="ref">SN.iii.257<em>ff.</em></span> <span class="ref">SN.iv.391<em>ff.</em></span> The three Vacchagotta Suttas of the Majjhima Nikāya seem to contain the story of Vacchagotta’s conversion, in due order: at the conclusion of the Tevijja Vacchagotta it is merely stated that “the Paribbājaka Vacchagotta rejoiced in what the Blessed One has said.” At the end of the next, the Aggi Vacchagotta, he is mentioned as having accepted the Buddha as his teacher. In the third, the Mahā Vacchagotta, he seeks ordination from the Buddha at Rājagaha, and receives it after the requisite probationary period of four months. He returns to the Buddha after two weeks and tells him that he has attained all that is to be attained by a non arahant’s understanding and asks for a further exposition of the Doctrine. The Buddha tells him to proceed to the study of calm and insight, whereby sixfold <i>abhiññā</i> may be acquired. Vacchagotta profits by the lesson and soon after becomes an arahant. He thereupon sends news of his attainment to the Buddha through some monks, and the Buddha says he has already heard the news from the devas. <span class="ref">MN.i.493–497</span></p><p>This story definitely identifies the Paribbājaka with the Thera of the same name, whose verse of ecstasy is included in the Theragāthā. <span class="ref">Thag.112</span></p><p>Vacchagotta was a native of Rājagaha, but seems to have travelled widely, for we find him visiting the Buddha at Vesāli, <span class="ref">MN.i.481</span> at Sāvatthī, <span class="ref">MN.i.483</span> <span class="ref">SN.iii.257</span> and at Ñātikā, <span class="ref">SN.iv.401</span> in addition to his visits to Rājagaha. <span class="ref">MN.i.489</span></p><p>in the Aṅguttara Nikāya <span class="ref">AN.i.180<em>f.</em></span> a Vacchagotta who is a wanderer visits the Buddha at Venāgapura, where he was at the head of the brahmins.

Vajjiyamāhita refuted their arguments, maintaining that the Buddha declared what was good and what was bad, and that the truth of his teachings could be proved. Having thus silenced them, he sought the Buddha, to whom he repeated the conversation. The Buddha praised him, and said it was untrue that he discouraged all austerity and asceticism; such penances as led to the destruction of evil states and the promotion of good states, he welcomed and encouraged.

<p>A brahmin, chief minister of Ajātasattu.

The Buddha said that as long as the Vajjians practised the seven conditions of prosperity which he had taught them at Sārandada cetiya, they would prosper rather than decline.</p><p>In the Gopaka Moggallāna Sutta, <span class="ref">MN.iii.8<em>ff.</em></span> Vassakāra is represented as arriving in the middle of a conversation, which Gopaka Moggallāna was holding with Ānanda, having been sent to inspect the works at Rājagaha, which were in charge of Moggallāna. Having asked the subject of conversation, he inquired whether the Buddha himself or the Order had chosen a leader for the Saṅgha after the Buddha’s death. Ānanda explains that the Buddha did not do so, that no special leader has been appointed, but that there were monks to whom they showed honour and reverence because of their virtue and insight. Vassakāra admits this as good, as does also Upananda, the Senāpati, who is present. Vassakāra asks Ānanda where he lives, and is told, in Veḷuvana. Vassakāra thinks this a good place for the practice of <i>jhāna</i>, and tells Ānanda of a conversation he once had with the Buddha regarding <i>jhāna</i>. Ānanda, remarks that all <i>jhānas</i> are not equally praiseworthy, and Vassakāra takes his leave.</p><p>Three conversations between the Buddha and Vassakāra are recorded in the Aṅguttara Nikāya, all three taking place at Veḷuvana.</p><p>On discovering that a certain forest official had given tribute to Dhaniya without the king’s special leave, he reported the man to the king and had him punished. <span class="ref">Vin.iii.42<em>ff.</em></span> In this context we find that Vassakāra was Mahāmatta to Bimbisāra as well.</p>

There Vepacitti reviled and railed at Sakka with scurrilous words, both on entering and on leaving the hall, but Sakka remained silent, and, when questioned by Mātali, said it was not proper for him to bandy words with a fool. <span class="ref">SN.i.221<em>f.</em></span> <span class="ref">SN.iv.201</span> His bondage caused him no inconvenience so long as he remained with the devas, but the moment he experienced the wish to rejoin the Asuras, he felt himself bound.

Sakka agreed to this, and Vepacitti, as the older god, was asked to speak a verse. Sakka spoke another, the Devas applauding. Several verses were spoken by each, and both Devas and Asuras decided in favour of Sakka, because Vepacitti’s verses belonged, they said, to the sphere of violence, while those of Sakka belonged to one of concord and harmony. <span class="ref">SN.i.222<em>f.</em></span> Once, when Sakka was revolving in his mind the thought that he should not betray even his enemy, Vepacitti read his thoughts and came up to him. “Stop,” said Sakka, “thou art my prisoner”; but Vepacitti reminded him of his thought, and was allowed to go free. <span class="ref">SN.i.225</span></p><p>When Vepacitti lay ill, Sakka visited him and offered to cure him if he would teach him Sambara’s magic art.

</div><p>A town in which the Buddha once spent the rainy season at the invitation of the brahmin Verañja. Verañja visits the Buddha at the foot of the Naḷerupucimanda, where he is staying, and asks him a series of questions, the first of which is: whether it be true that the Buddha pays no respect to aged brahmins. The Buddha replies that he has not seen a brahmin in the whole world to whom such respect is due from him. If the Tathāgata were so to honour anyone, that person’s head would split in pieces. Other questions follow on the Buddha’s doctrine and practices. The Buddha concludes by giving an account of his attainment of the threefold knowledge. The interview ends with the conversion of Verañja and his invitation to the Buddha to spend his rainy season there.</p><p>At that time there was a famine, and five hundred householders of Uttarāpatha, staying at Verañjā, supplied the monks with food. Moggallāna proposed to get food by the exercise of his magic power or by going with the monks to Uttarakuru, but he was dissuaded by the Buddha. During this stay Sāriputta received from the Buddha an explanation as to why the religious systems of the three previous Buddhas lasted so long, while those of the three preceding them—​​Vipassī, Sikhī and Vesabhū—​​did not.</p><p>At the conclusion of the vassa, the Buddha wished to take leave of Verañja before setting out, as was the custom of Buddhas when they received hospitality. Verañja admitted that, though he had invited the Buddha, he had not kept his promise, and this was due to his having too many duties in the house.</p><p>He invited the Buddha and the monks to a meal the next day, and, at the end of the meal, presented a set of three robes to the Buddha and a pair to each of the monks.</p><p>After leaving Verañjā the Buddha went to Benares, passing through Soreyya, Saṅkassa and Kaṇṇakujja, and crossing the Ganges at Payāgapatiṭṭhāna. From Benares he proceeded to Vesāli. This account, of the Buddha’s visit to Verañjā, forms the introduction to the Vinaya. <span class="ref">Vin.iii.1–11</span> The interview with Verañja is given in the Aṅguttara. <span class="ref">AN.iv.172<em>ff.</em></span></p><p>A road led from Verañjā to Madhurā, and the Aṅguttara Nikāya <span class="ref">AN.ii.57<em>f.</em></span> contains a sermon preached by the Buddha to a large number of people while he rested by the roadside. There was evidently frequent intercourse between Sāvatthī and Verañjā, and the Verañjaka Sutta was preached to some brahmins who visited the Buddha at Sāvatthī, whither they had gone on business. The books also record <span class="ref">AN.iv.198<em>f.</em></span> a visit paid by the Asura Pahārāda to the Buddha at Verañjā.</p>

</div><p>A city, capital of the Licchavis. It is not possible to know how many visits were paid by the Buddha to Vesāli, but the books would lead us to infer that they were several.

On the last day of this visit, after his meal, he went with Ānanda to Cāpāla cetiya for his siesta, and, in the course of their conversation, he spoke to Ānanda of the beauties of Vesāli: of the Udena cetiya, the Gotamaka cetiya, the Sattambaka cetiya, the Bahuputta cetiya, and the Sārandada cetiya. Other monasteries are also mentioned, in or near Vesāli e.g., Pātikārāma, Vālikārāma.</p><p>The Buddha generally stayed at the Kūṭāgārasālā during his visits to Vesāli, but it appears that he sometimes lived at these different shrines. <span class="ref">DN.ii.118</span> During his last visit to the Cāpāla cetiya he decided to die within three months, and informed Māra and, later, Ānanda, of his decision. The next day he left Vesāli for Bhaṇḍagāma, after taking one last look at the city, “turning his whole body round, like an elephant”. <span class="ref">DN.ii.122</span> The rainy season which preceded this, the Buddha spent at Beluvagāma, a suburb of Vesāli, while the monks stayed in and around Vesāli. On the day before he entered into the vassa, Ambapāli invited the Buddha and the monks to a meal, at the conclusion of which she gave her Ambavana for the use of the Order. <span class="ref">DN.ii.98</span></p><p>Among eminent followers of the Buddha who lived in Vesāli, special mention is made of Ugga, Piṅgiyāni, Kāraṇapālī, Sīha, Vāseṭṭha, <span class="ref">AN.iv.258</span> and the various Licchavis.</p><p>Vesāli was a stronghold of the Nigaṇṭhas. The Buddha’s presence in Vesāli was a source of discomfort to the Nigaṇṭhas, and we find mention of various devices resorted to by them to prevent their followers from coming under the influence of the Buddha.</p><p>At the time of the Buddha, Vesāli was a very large city, rich and prosperous, crowded with people and with abundant food. Its courtesan, Ambapālī, was famous for her beauty, and helped in large measure in making the city prosperous. <span class="ref">Vin.i.268</span></p><p>Outside the town was the Mahāvana, a large, natural forest. Near by were other forests, such as Gosiṅgalasāla. <span class="ref">AN.v.134</span></p><p>Among important suttas preached at Vesāli are the Mahāli, Mahāsīhanāda, Cūḷa Saccaka, Mahā Saccaka, Tevijja, Vacchagotta, Sunakkhatta and Ratana.</p><p>One hundred years after the Buddha’s death Vesāli was again the scene of interest for Buddhists, on account of the “Ten Points” raised by the Vajjiputtaka, and the second Council held in connection with this dispute at the Vālikārāma.</p><p>There were Nāgas living in Vesāli; these were called Vesālā. <span class="ref">DN.ii.258</span></p>

(Cf. Indra’s epithet Purandara, destroyer of cities) </li><li>Sakka, because he gives generously and thoroughly (<i>sakkaccaṃ</i>). Sakra occurs many times in the Vedas as an adjective, qualifying gods (chiefly Indra), and is explained as meaning “able, capable.” It is, however, not found as a name in pre Buddhist times.</li><li>Vāsava, <span class="ref">SN.i.221</span> <span class="ref">SN.i.223</span> <span class="ref">SN.i.229–2​30</span> <span class="ref">SN.i.234–223​7</span> <span class="ref">DN.ii.260</span> <span class="ref">DN.ii.274</span> <span class="ref">Snp.384</span> which is explained in the Saṃyutta Nikāya <span class="ref">SN.i.229</span> by saying that when he was a human being, in his previous birth, he gave dwelling places. According to the Dīgha Nikāya, <span class="ref">DN.ii.260</span> however, he is Vāsava because he is chief of the Vasū.</li><li>Sahassakkha or Sahassanetta (Thousand-eyed) because in one moment he can think of one thousand matters.</li><li>Sujampati, because he married the Asura maiden Sujā</li></ul><p>Elsewhere <span class="ref">DN.ii.270</span> <span class="ref">MN.i.252</span> Sakka is addressed as Kosiya.</p><p>He is also spoken of as Yakkha. <span class="ref">MN.i.252</span> <span class="ref">SN.i.206</span> ; at S.i.47 Māgha<i>devaputta</i> is called Vatrabhū, slayer of Vṛṭra.</p><p>Sakka rules over Tāvatiṃsā, the lowest heaven. His palace is Vejayanta and his chariot bears the same name. Though king of the Tāvatiṃsā devas, he is no absolute monarch. He is imagined rather in the likeness of a chieftain of a Kosala clan. The devas meet and deliberate in the Sudhamma sabhā and Sakka consults with them rather than issues them commands. On such occasions, the Four Regent Devas are present in the assembly with their followers of the Cātummahārājika world.<span class="ref">DN.ii.207<em>f.</em></span> <span class="ref">DN.ii.220<em>f.</em></span> Among the Tāvatiṃsā devas, Sakka surpasses his companions in ten things: length of life, beauty, happiness, renown, power; and in the degree of his five sense experiences: sight, hearing, smelling, taste and touch. <span class="ref">AN.iv.242</span></p><p>In the Saṃyutta Nikāya <span class="ref">SN.i.228</span> <span class="ref">SN.i.229</span> <span class="ref">SN.i.231</span> the Buddha gives seven rules of conduct, which rules Sakka carried out as a human being, thus attaining to his celestial sovereignty. When the devas fight the Asuras they do so under the banner and orders of Sakka.</p><p>In the Saṃyutta Nikāya a whole Saṃyutta—​​one of the shortest, consisting of twenty five short suttas—​​is devoted to Sakka.</p><p>Sakka was considered by the early Buddhists as a god of high character, kindly and just, but not perfect, and not very intelligent. His imperfections are numerous: in spite of his very great age, he is still subject to death and rebirth <span class="ref">AN.i.144</span> ; as an example of this, it is mentioned that Sunetta had thirty five times been reborn as Sakka, <span class="ref">AN.iv.105</span> a statement confirmed by the Buddha. <span class="ref">AN.iv.89</span></p><p>In the Sakkapañha Sutta, Sakka is said to have visited the Buddha at Vediyagiri in Ambasaṇḍā and to have asked him a series of questions. He sends Pañcasikha with his vinā to play and sing to the Buddha and to obtain permission for him to visit him and question him.</p><p>The Buddha says to himself that Sakka, for a long time past, has led a pure life, and gives him permission to question him on any subject. It is stated in the course of the sutta <span class="ref">DN.ii.270</span> that it was not the first time that Sakka had approached the Buddha for the same purpose. He had gone to him at the Salaghara in Sāvatthī, but found him in meditation, with Bhuñjatī, wife of Vessavaṇa, waiting on him. He therefore left with a request to Bhuñjatī to greet the Buddha in his name. He also declares <span class="ref">DN.ii.286</span> that he has become a sotāpanna and has earned for himself the right to be reborn eventually in the Akaniṭṭhā world, whence he will pass entirely away. Sakka admits <span class="ref">DN.ii.284</span> that he visited other brahmins and recluses as well. They were pleased to see him, and boasted that they had nothing to teach him; but he had to teach them what he knew.</p><p>An account of another interview which Sakka had with the Buddha is given in the Cūḷataṇhāsaṅkhaya Sutta. There the question arises regarding the extirpation of cravings. Sakka accepts the Buddha’s answer and leaves him. Anxious to discover whether Sakka has understood the Buddha’s teaching, Moggallāna visits Sakka and questions him. Sakka evades the questions and shows Moggallāna the glories of his Vejayanta palace. Moggallāna then frightens him by a display of <i>iddhi</i>-power, and Sakka repeats to him, word for word, the Buddha’s answer. Moggallāna departs satisfied, and Sakka tells his handmaidens that Moggallāna is a “fellow of his” in the higher life, meaning, probably, that he himself is a sotāpanna and therefore a kinsman of the arahant.</p><p>In a passage in the Saṃyutta. <span class="ref">SN.i.201</span> Sakka is represented as descending from heaven to make an enquiry about Nibbāna, and in another <span class="ref">SN.iv.269<em>f.</em></span> as listening, in heaven, to Moggallāna’s exposition of the simplest duties of a good layman. On another occasion, at Vessavaṇa’s suggestion, Sakka visited Uttara Thera on the Sankheyyaka Mountain and listened to a sermon by him. <span class="ref">AN.iv.163<em>f.</em></span></p>

<p>A very learned brahmin of Candalakappa. One day he saw Dhānañjānī trip up, and heard her exclaim three times, “Glory to the Buddha, the arahant, the all enlightened.” He blamed her for thus extolling a shovelling monk, but when she told him of the Buddha’s marvellous qualities, he felt a desire to see him. Some time after, the Buddha went to Candalakappa and stayed in Todeyya’s Mango grove. When Dhānañjānī told Saṅgārava that he was there, Saṅgārava visited him and questioned him on his views on brahmins. The Buddha said he had great regard for brahmins who had here and now won the goal, having discovered unaided a doctrine before unknown. He himself was one of these. He then proceeds to describe how he came to leave the household life and how, in due course, he won Enlightenment. Saṅgārava asks further whether there are any gods.

Sanaṅkumāra was present at the preaching of the Mahāsamaya Sutta. <span class="ref">DN.ii.261</span></p><p>In the Janavasabha Sutta, Janavasabha describes to the Buddha an occasion on which Sanaṅkumāra attended an assembly of the Devas, presided over by Sakka and the Four Regent Gods. There was suddenly a vast radiance, and the devas knew of the approach of Sanaṅkumāra. As the usual appearance of the Brahmā is not sufficiently materialized for him to be perceived by the Devas of Tāvatiṃsā, he is forced to appear as a relatively gross personality which he specially creates. As he arrives, the Devas sit in their places with clasped hands waiting for him to choose his seat. Then Sanaṅkumāra takes on the form of Pañcasikha and sits, above the assembly, cross legged, in the air. So seated, he expresses his satisfaction that Sakka and all the Tāvatiṃsā Devas should honour and follow the Buddha. His voice has all the eight characteristics of a Brahmā’s voice. <span class="ref">DN.ii.211</span> He then proceeds to create thirty three shaper, of himself, each sitting on the divan of a Tāvatiṃsā Deva, and addresses the Devas, speaking of the advantages of taking refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saṅgha. Each deva fancies that only the shape sitting on his own divan has spoken and that the others are silent. Then Sanaṅkumāra goes to the end of the Hall, and, seated on Sakka’s throne, addresses the whole assembly on the four ways of <i>iddhi</i>; on the three avenues leading to Bliss, as manifested by the Buddha; on the four <i>satipaṭṭhānas</i>, and the seven <i>samādhiparikkhārā</i>. He declares that more than twenty four lakhs of Māgadha disciples, having followed the teachings of the Buddha, have been born in the deva worlds. When Sanaṅkumāra has finished his address, Vessavaṇa wonders if there have been Buddhas in the past and will be in the future. The Brahmā reads his thoughts and says there certainly were and will be.</p>

From there he went with the Buddha to Kosambī, where the lay disciples, hearing of his wondrous feat, paid him great honour. When they asked what they could do for his comfort, he remained silent, but the Chabbaggiyā suggested that they should provide him with white spirits.</p><p>The next day, when Sāgata went for alms, he was invited to various houses, where the inmates plied him with intoxicating drinks. So deep were his potations that on his way out of the town he fell prostrate at the gateway. The monks carried him, and at the monastery they laid him down with his head at the Buddha’s feet, but he turned round so that his feet lay towards the Buddha. The Buddha pointed out his condition to the monks, using it as an example of the evil effects of liquor; and he made this the occasion for the passing of a rule against the use of alcohol. <span class="ref">Vin.iv.108<em>f.</em></span></p><p>The Buddha later declared him foremost among those skilled in the contemplation of the heat element. <span class="ref">AN.i.25</span></p>

<p>A Licchavi general of Vesāli. He was a follower of the Nigaṇṭhas. When the Buddha visited Vesāli, Sīha, having heard reports of his greatness, wished to see him, but Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta dissuaded him, saying that Gotama denied the result of actions and was not worth a visit. But in the end Sīha, accompanied by five hundred chariots, went to the Buddha. Having discovered in conversation with the Buddha that he was falsely accused of preaching wrong doctrines, Sīha declared himself the Buddha’s follower. The Buddha accepted his adherence on condition that he would continue to give alms to any Nigaṇṭhas who sought them at his house. This generosity made Sīha honour the Buddha even more highly, and he invited him and the monks to a meal on the next day. Meat formed one of the dishes, and the Nigaṇṭhas went about Vesāli crying that Sīha had killed a large ox to provide meat for the Buddha and his monks and that the food had been accepted. This was the occasion for the formulation of the rule that no monk should eat flesh where he has reason to believe that the animal had been specially killed for him. <span class="ref">Vin.i.233<em>f.</em></span> <span class="ref">AN.iv.179<em>f.</em></span></p><p>The Aṅguttara Nikāya <span class="ref">AN.iii.38<em>f.</em></span> <span class="ref">AN.iv.79<em>f.</em></span> contains two discussions, in more or less identical terms, in which Sīha asks the Buddha if it is possible to show the visible results of giving.

When there was a famine in the Vajji country, Sudinna went to Vesāli, hoping to be kept by his rich relations, to the mutual benefit of both parties. They gave him sixty bowls of rice, which he distributed among his colleagues. When he went to his father’s house, in Kalandakagāma, he saw a servant girl about to throw away some boiled rice and asked her to put it into his bowl. The girl, recognizing his hands and feet and voice, told his mother of his arrival. Both she and his father visited him as he was eating the rice, and his father took him by the hand and led him home. There he was provided with a seat and asked to eat: but he refused, saying he had already eaten. The next day he was again invited; he went, and they tried to tempt him back to the lay life. His former wife joined in the attempt, but on being addressed by him as “Sister,” she fell fainting. Then he begged for his meal, saying that if they desired to give it to him they should do so without worrying him. Later his wife visited him, with his mother, at the Mahāvana, and begged that he would give her a son, so that the Licchavis might not confiscate their wealth for want of an heir. Sudinna agreed, and had intercourse three times with her. She became pregnant, and in due course a son was born, who was called Bījaka. When Sudinna realized what he had done he was filled with remorse, and his colleagues, discovering the reason, reported him to the Buddha, who blamed him greatly. <span class="ref">Vin.iii.11–21</span></p>

Citta heard Sāriputta preach, and, at the end of the sermon, invited him and the monks to his house the next day. He also invited Sudhamma, but because he had been invited after the others, Sudhamma refused to go. Early the next day he visited Citta’s house to see what offerings had been prepared, and after seeing them, remarked that one thing was missing: sesame cakes. Then Citta rebuked him, comparing him to a crow, the offspring of a cock and a crow. Sudhamma left the house in anger, and going to Sāvatthī, reported the matter to the Buddha. The Buddha blamed Sudhamma and said that the Saṅgha should pass the <i>paṭisāraṇīyakamma</i> on him.

<p>A Licchavi prince of Vesāli. He was, at one time, a member of the Order and the personal attendant of the Buddha, but was later converted to the views of Korakkhattiya and went about defaming the Buddha, saying that he had nothing superhuman and was not distinguished from other men by preaching a saving faith: that the doctrine preached by him did not lead to the destruction of sorrow, etc. Sāriputta, on his alms rounds in Vesāli, heard all this and reported it to the Buddha, who thereupon preached the Mahāsīhanāda Sutta. <span class="ref">MN.i.68<em>ff.</em></span> The Sunakkhatta Sutta <span class="ref">MN.ii.252<em>ff.</em></span> was evidently preached to Sunakkhatta before he joined the Order, while the Pātika Sutta <span class="ref">DN.iii.1<em>ff.</em></span> gives an account of his dissatisfaction.</p><p>His grievance was that the Buddha showed no mystic superhuman wonders, that he had not shown him the beginning of things. The Buddha reminded him that he had not promised to do any of these things, and that, at one time, Sunakkhatta had been loud in his praise of the Buddha and the Dhamma. The Buddha warned him that people would say he had left the Order because its discipline had proved too hard for him. The Buddha had told him that Korakkhattiya, whom he so much admired, would be born after death among the Kālakañjaka Asuras within seven days. It happened as the Buddha prophesied, and the dead body of Kora declared that he was right. But even so, Sunakkhatta was not convinced.</p><p>Later he transferred his allegiance to Kandaramasaka, who died, as the Buddha had prophesied, fallen from grace and fame. The next teacher to win the admiration of Sunakkhatta was Pātikaputta, and Sunakkhatta wished the Buddha to pay honour to him. But the Buddha quoted to Sunakkhatta the words of Ajita, the Licchavi general who had been born in Tāvatiṃsā, to the effect that Pātikaputta was “a liar and a cheat,” and was later able to prove that these words were true. But Sunakkhatta did not return to the Order. He had probably remained in it for several years before actually leaving it. For we find in the Mahāli Sutta <span class="ref">DN.i.152</span> the Licchavi Oṭṭhaddha relating to the Buddha how Sunakkhatta had come to him three years after joining the Order, claiming that he could see divine forms but could not hear heavenly sounds.

<p>A brahmin, one of the Bhāradvājas. Once, when he was performing Fire-rites on the banks of the Sundarikā, he looked round to see if there were anyone, to whom he could give what was left over from the oblations. He saw the Buddha seated under a tree, his head covered; he approached him with the oblation and a water pitcher and addressed him. The Buddha uncovered his head. The sight of the shaven head at first made Sundarika draw back, but, realizing that some brahmins too were shaved, he questioned the Buddha about his birth. The Buddha explained to him that the important thing was not birth, but the leading of a good life. The brahmin was pleased and offered him the oblation, but the Buddha refused it, saying that he did not accept presents for chanting verses. He advised Sundarika to throw the food into the water, where there were no creatures, for who could digest food which had once been offered to a Buddha? The brahmin followed this advice and saw the water hiss and seethe with steam and smoke. Alarmed and with hair on end, he worshipped the Buddha, who preached to him. <span class="ref">SN.i.167<em>f.</em></span> The account of the meeting between the Buddha and Sundarika is given in the Sutta Nipāta too, <span class="ref">Snp.p.79<em>f.</em></span> but there the details differ greatly, though the topic of discussion is the same.

She would then spend it in a neighbouring monastery of the Paribbājakas and be seen again early in the morning coming from the direction of Jetavana. After some days, the heretics hired some villains to kill Sundarī and hide her body under a heap of rubbish near Jetavana. Then they raised a hue and cry and reported to the king that Sundarī was missing. A search was made, and her body was found near the Gandhakuti of the Buddha. Placing the body on a litter, they went about the streets of the city crying— “Behold the deeds of the Sākyan monks!” As a result, the monks were subjected to great insults in the streets. For seven days the Buddha stayed in the Gandhakuti, not going to the city for alms, and Ānanda even suggested that they should go to another city.</p><p>But the Buddha pointed out to him the absurdity of running away from a false report, and said that in seven days the truth would be known. The king employed spies, who found the murderers quarrelling among themselves after strong drink. They were seized and brought before the king, where they confessed their crime. The king sent for the heretics and compelled them to retract their accusations against the Buddha and his monks and to confess their own wickedness.

<p>A lotus pond near Rājagaha. The Saṃyutta Nikāya mentions the Buddha as relating the story of a man who went to Sumāgadhā with the thought, “I will speculate about the world.” He saw an army, with its four divisions, enter a lotus stalk. He then thought he must be mad and told everyone so. The Buddha explained that what the man had seen was real; it was an Asura army, fleeing from the devas in panic, through a lotus stalk. <span class="ref">SN.v.447<em>f.</em></span></p><p>Near the pond was the Moranivāpa, and within walking distance was the Paribbājakārāma in Queen Udumbarika’s park. The Buddha was walking about in the open air near Sumāgadhā, just before he preached the Udumbarikasīhanāda Sutta. <span class="ref">DN.iii.40</span></p>

The Buddha gave him a subject for meditation, and he went to Sītavana, but many people visited him and he was unable to concentrate. He strove hard, and, through pacing up and down in meditation, painful sores developed on his feet. But he won no attainment and was filled with despair. The Buddha saw this and taught him that when he was a <i>vīṇā</i> player his <i>vīṇā</i> sounded neither tuneful nor playable when the strings were either over-strung or over-lax. Even so, energy, when over-strung, ends in flurry, when over-lax, in idleness. Soṇa profits by the lesson and becomes an arahant.

Soṇa then sought the Buddha alone and joined the Order. After ordination he walked about meditating, his feet bled, and his cankamana was covered with blood “like a slaughter house for oxen.” After Soṇa attained arahantship, the Buddha gave him permission to wear shoes with one lining. Soṇa said he had abandoned eighty cartloads of gold and a retinue of seven elephants. He did not wish, as a monk, to have any luxuries which his colleagues did not share.

<p>A monk. He was a Sākyan and loved holding discussions with the heretics. When he suffered defeat at their hands, he would resort to falsehood and evasion, or would ask his opponent to and meet him somewhere and then go there before the appointed time and give it out that his opponent had avoided him.

<p>An eminent lay disciple of the Buddha declared foremost among those who gather a following by means of the four bases of sympathy. <span class="ref">AN.i.26</span> The books record several conversations between the Buddha and Hatthaka. He once saw the Buddha at Gomagga in Siṃsapāvana, near Alavi, and asked him if he were one of those who lived happily. The Buddha said he was always happy in any circumstances. <span class="ref">AN.i.136<em>f.</em></span> On another occasion the Buddha asked Hatthaka how he could command the allegiance of such a large company. “By the four bases of sympathy,” he answered, by giving gifts, by kindly words, by kindly deeds, by equality of treatment. And when Hatthaka had gone, the Buddha praised him for his eminence, in that he possessed eight marvellous qualities: faith, virtue, conscientiousness, fear of blame, ability to listen well, charity, wisdom, modesty. <span class="ref">AN.iv.218<em>f.</em></span> <span class="ref">AN.iv.216</span></p><p>Together with Cittagahapati, Hatthaka is often held up as an example to be copied by others. <span class="ref">SN.ii.235</span> <span class="ref">AN.i.88</span> <span class="ref">AN.ii.164</span> <span class="ref">AN.iii.451</span></p><p>After death, Hatthaka was born in Avihā, there to pass away entirely. From there he once visited the Buddha and tried to stand in his presence, but collapsed and could not remain upright. The Buddha then asked him to create a gross body form, and when he did this he was able to stand. He told the Buddha that he was constantly surrounded by devas wishing to learn the Dhamma from him, and confessed that he had died regretting three things: of not having seen enough of the Buddha, of not heard enough of the Dhamma, of not served enough the Saṅgha. <span class="ref">AN.i.278<em>f.</em></span></p>
